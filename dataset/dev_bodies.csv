8,"There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that we’ve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights. Fake DHL ads. Amazing viral video? Nope — a Jimmy Kimmel stunt!

So, rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, we’re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldn’t share over the weekend.

Ready? Here’s what was fake on the Internet this week:

1. The Nobel Committee doesn’t “regret” giving President Obama the Peace Prize. According to an invented “news release” uploaded to Scribd by the prominent blogger and anti-war activist David Swanson, the Nobel Institute can’t retract Obama’s 2009 Peace Prize — but wishes it could. “It remains the obligation of the Committee to disassociate itself from actions taken by laureates that frustrate rather than advancing [sic] the fraternity between nations,” the statement reads. (Pro-tip: International organizations rarely make glaring grammatical errors in major statements.) “The Committee therefore joins with the public statements of several Nobel Peace Laureates in expressing its regrets over the conduct of the 2009 prize recipient.” The announcement has since been picked up by a number of right-wing outlets, including Before It’s News. The only problem, of course: It isn’t true.

Dear Internet: The Nobel committee ″regrets” giving Obama the 2009 peace prize story is bogus. I just spoke with the head of the institute

2. There is no-such thing as a “pumpkin-spice-flavored condom.” Though considering the social media response to the idea, some enterprising company may want to give it a try. A Photoshopped image of the “limited edition” Durex condom circulated widely on Twitter and Facebook last week before a punny statement from Durex punctured the hoax: “We can’t claim this one,” the company said, “but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.” Har har. In unrelated pumpkin-spice news, the limited-edition Oreos of the flavor are apparently quite real.

We’ve officially reached Pumpkin Spice saturation point. pic.twitter.com/Tve77ov5JZ

3. No one expects “record-shattering snowfall” this year. That claim — like so many others! — comes from the unfunny “satirists” at EmpireNews.net, increasingly our least favorite fake-news site in a generally unfavorable field. According to the story and its accompanying map, meteorologists have expected “above normal snowfall” in huge swaths of the United States, including the entire mid-Atlantic coast. Like everything else on Empire News, of course, the map is fake. Moreover, it’s so difficult to predict seasonal weather patterns that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration doesn’t bust theirs out until November, and the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., told the Baltimore Sun they have virtually no idea what the snow will look like three long months from now.

#InOtherNews I just read a report that a meteorologist said we will be having ″record shattering snowfall” this winter. Lord Jesus.

4. “Male birth control” will probably not be here by 2017. A number of outlets gleefully proclaimed the news that a “male birth control” injection, called Vasalgel, would be hitting the world’s bedrooms within three years. Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that it’s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration — and neither of those things are true. “The news came from a press release — and call for donations! — by the foundation behind Vasalgel,” Julia Belluz explained at Vox, “highlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.” Bottom line: It’s great that someone’s working on male birth control, but it’s highly unlikely this particular product will reach the U.S. market by 2017.

5. There was not a shooting at a California Marine Corps base. An anonymous Facebook page sparked all-out panic at a base north of San Diego on Thursday night when it posted that a shooter was active at the military installation and that “ALL MARINES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOCK THEMSELVES INSIDE OF THEIR ROOMS.” The page then stupidly followed that prank post up with a number of “updates” on the situation, which were liked and shared hundreds of times. Base police told Business Insider there was no evidence at all of a shooting: People “saw if on social media networks and then they started telling their friends,” one dispatcher said. “It’s all rumor, it’s all hearsay.”

Possible shooter in Camp Pendleton!? Anybody hear anything??

6. Shakira is not dead. The singer’s hips don’t lie, but the Internet does. Constantly. A hoax e-mail bearing the logo of Mexican newspaper El Universal claimed that Shakira died in a car accident in Colombia last week, and that an attached Word document contained “exclusive images and details” from the scene. Colombia’s Informador reports that the e-mail may actually have contained a virus or phishing scam. As for Shakira, she’s alive and well and expecting her second child with boyfriend Gerard Pique.

7. British Muslims are not trying to outlaw a beloved children’s TV show. A comedian going by the name Zayn Sheikh outraged many Brits (and fooled a number of news outlets, British and otherwise) with a YouTube video that demanded the TV show “Peppa Pig” go off air and suggested a national campaign would soon organize for that purpose. Peppa Pig is a beloved, alliterative British cartoon character — and also “haram,” or forbidden to Muslims, Sheikh claimed. Over the weekend, Sheikh posted a second video admitting the whole thing was a hoax — but a hoax for a cause. “This video served to show how much Islamophobia is around, for those who deny its existence,” he wrote. “It is sad to live in a society where some feel that Muslims have no rights to talk at all.”

8. Obama will not “resign amid new Benghazi revelations.” Every word of this headline is a dream come true to some of the president’s more conspiracy-minded opponents, which perhaps explains why the fake article, from fake-article-generator National Report, went viral in those circles. As of this writing, it’s been shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. Even Donald Trump seems to have fallen for the “joke”!

If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!

(Just kidding, that tweet is related to another matter entirely.)

9. Cocaine has not been found in Coors Light beer. Since this is the second widespread cocaine-in-a-beverage hoax in as many weeks, let’s get a few things straight about the alleged phenomenon. First up: This hoax seems to do well because it has some remote, and long ago, bases in fact. (Cocaine-laced sodas and beverages were very popular in ye olden days, around the time of the Civil War.) It also helps that remote traces of coca have been found, at some point in time, in various popular beverages, including Red Bull. That said, no cocaine expose published on a site called Huzlers.com is ever going to be real. Ever. How have 286,000 people shared this stupid thing?

10. The ruins of an ancient city were not discovered in the Australian desert. Perhaps the most incredible thing about this faux-story from World News Daily Report — besides the number of times people have reposted it to Facebook — is the amazingly credulous conversation readers are having in the comments section below it. “I thought the climate in central Australia had been arid for over 30,000 years,” one commenter wrote. “30,000 people living in the desert? That would require agriculture and irrigation … That’s just incredible!” Indeed.

27,"Phoenix, AZ — A Phoenix boy is behind bars tonight after his mother called 9-1-1 when she found her son in his room, watching pornography and masturbating. Phoenix Police were quick to respond, arresting 15-year-old Paul Horner, who attends North Valley High School in Phoenix, Arizona. Now the teenager is being held without bail and charged by prosecutors under a new controversial Arizona state law called ‘Self-Rape’, which carries a minimum of 3 years in prison with a maximum of 15 years behind bars depending on that individuals past criminal history.

This is the first time this new state law has been used since it was put into action last month by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. Brewer spoke with local news station ABC 15 about the charges against the boy.

“I applaud the Arizona District court systems here in Phoenix,” Brewer said. “This is exactly why I implemented the state law of ‘Self-Rape’ last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. Before my time as governor is up early next year, I’ll do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don’t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it’s too late.”

Horner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the United States District Court in Phoenix, which included the brand new ‘Self-Rape’ state law, Horner immediately broke down into tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.

Transcripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Help! My son is watching porn and masturbating! That is not allowed in his house and I don’t know what kind of demons possessed him to degrade his body in such a matter. I’m so shakin’ up! Please send help immediately!”

32-year-old Adeline Horner, Horner’s mother, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.

“Up until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,” Horner’s mother said. “But somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil’s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!”

Winters controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.

“STOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Adeline Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,” Childs told reporters. “She really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.”

A mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Ant-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 36-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.

“Fappy® has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things. Our organization is passionate about the great work that we do. The children even have a nickname for Fappy®, they call him the tickle monster. Working side by side with such great women as Jan Brewer, we’re ridding the demons from these heathens pants, one pair of pants at a time. Fappy® vows to stay on this case until justice is served!”

Tom Downey with the Phoenix Police Department, who took the child into custody, spoke with Arizona news station Fox 10 News about the arrest.

“We thought at first he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about how we should leave him alone and just let him watch his filth, makes me sick! It’s a slippery slope my friend, one day it’s masturbating to porn, the next day it’s raping some innocent school girl. Thank God we got this heathen off the streets before another tragedy could have occurred.” Downey continued, “There’s no better feeling than putting the real bad guys behind bars. Nothing better than that. I know I can sleep better at night just knowing another criminal is off the streets.”

Officers confiscated the pornography and lube found in the teenagers room as evidence.

Prosecutors told local reporters that based on the severity of the crime, the new Arizona state law of Self-Rape [A.R.S. §§ 29-169 & 48-69] would carry a minimum of 3 years with a maximum of 15 years depending on that criminals past history.

Horner is currently being held at the Maricopa County Jail in Phoenix, Arizona. He presently has no bond set and the judge has restricted him from seeing visitors. Horner’s next scheduled court appearance is December 2nd.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach both children and adults about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.

30,"DNA tests confirm Lebanon is holding the young daughter of Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the country's interior minister says.

Nohad Machnouk told Lebanon's MTV television that the child's mother, who is also in custody, was now believed to be one of Baghdadi's ex-wives.

On Tuesday, Lebanese security officials said they had detained his wife and son at a border crossing with Syria.

But Iraq's government later insisted the woman was not married to Baghdadi.

It said the woman - identified as Saja al-Dulaimi - was the daughter of an active member of al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, al-Nusra Front.

She is also thought to have been detained by the Syrian authorities before being freed in March as part of a prisoner exchange with al-Nusra.

Pregnant

Late on Wednesday, Mr Machnouk told MTV that Ms Dulaimi had been travelling with two sons and a daughter when they were detained by the army two weeks ago.

""Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,"" he said.

""Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child.""

The minister added: ""We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is [Baghdadi's] daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq.""

It is not clear how the Iraqi authorities have the IS leader's DNA. However, in 2005 he was arrested by US forces in Iraq and spent the next four years a prisoner at Camp Bucca, near the southern town of Um Qasr, before being handed over to the Iraqi authorities and then released.

Mr Machnouk said Ms Dulaimi's children were staying at a care centre while she was being interrogated at the defence ministry's headquarters.

IS has not commented on their detention, but al-Nusra has condemned it.

One Lebanese official has said it is a ""powerful card to apply pressure"" in negotiations with IS and al-Nusra, who are holding more than 20 Lebanese soldiers and police hostage. They are threatening to kill them unless militants are freed from Lebanese jails."

Joan Rivers‘ personal ear, nose, and throat doctor allegedly snapped a selfie with the comedienne while she was under general anesthesia for her throat procedure.

According to CNN, a Yorkville Endoscopy staff member told investigators the photograph was taken while Rivers was in the procedure room.

The 81-year-old entertainer went to the clinic to undergo a scheduled endoscopy by gastroenterologist and the clinic's medical director Dr. Lawrence Cohen, according to reports. After that procedure, CNN reports Rivers also underwent an unauthorized vocal cord biopsy performed by a physician, who hasn't been identified.

On Friday Yorkville Endoscopy announced Dr. Cohen was no longer medical director of the clinic, located in Manhattan. Reports are conflicting as to whether he voluntarily stepped down or was fired.

“Dr. Cohen is not currently performing procedures at Yorkville Endoscopy, nor is he currently serving as medical director,” a spokesperson from the clinic said in a statement obtained by TheWrap.

It was a bit of an uphill struggle for Jasmine, however, as she says she asked between 50 and 60 doctors but none of them wanted to do it because they would be breaking ethics codes.

It took two years to save up for the surgery but it has now been finished, topped off with a tattooed nipple.

82,"It was a heartwarming story for legions of pet owners and animal lovers around the world.

Pope Francis, talking to a distraught boy whose pet had died, declared there was a place in heaven for the creatures we share our lives with. His comment was reported this week by many news media outside Italy, with dozens of articles in the United States. It was veritable catnip to social media.

However, it turned out the pope had not made the comment.

The news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov. 26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago.

Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, once said, reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died, ""one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ.""

""There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done,"" the Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini, said on Saturday, when asked about how the media ran with the story.

The spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that.

Religion News Service was among the first media to set the record straight. It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov. 27, whose headline was misleading.


The article recounted the pope's words from his general audience on Nov. 26, when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth. It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI, but its headline said ""The pope and animals. 'paradise is open to all creatures.'""

The New York Times, which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis, acknowledged its mistake, saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope.

Asked about the mistake, a spokeswoman for the Times quoted Michael Slackman, managing editor of international news, as saying, ""The correction in The Times notes that the specific content and wording were wrong in the article. However, the pope did in fact make comments suggesting heaven is open to animals.""

In his Nov. 26 remarks, the pope referred to heaven saying ""the Sacred Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this marvelous plan cannot but affect all that which surrounds us and which emerged from the thought and the heart of God."" He did not refer specifically to animals in his remarks.

On its website, CNN also corrected its story, noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven. A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment.

Reuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis.

WHAT DOES THE POPE THINK ABOUT PETS?

As for what Francis does think about animals, he has not spoken much about them in public, but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures ""it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation.""

The spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased.

When he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year, Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it. The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs, Benedettini said.

Recent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals.

In 1990, Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God. In 2008, former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were ""called to eternity.""

88,"After a full day spent lying on her back on a muddy wooden plank, chipping with painstaking care at the underside of a stone block to free the time capsule hidden within, Museum of Fine Arts conservator Pam Hatchfield sat up in front of the State House to a round of applause, a green box held delicately in her hands.

“I feel happy and relieved. And excited. And really interested to see what’s in this box,” she said Thursday night, after posing for a selfie with the capsule for her mom. The extrication took more than seven hours and involved about a dozen workers.


The original contents of the time capsule were first placed in 1795 by Governor Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and William Scollay in a ceremony that started in downtown Boston and proceeded to the State House, according to historical accounts. It was unearthed during emergency repairs to the foundation in 1855 and then buried again, and had not seen daylight until it emerged on Thursday.

“Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building, but of our Commonwealth and our country,” said Secretary of State William Galvin, who was on hand for the capsule’s first appearance in more than 150 years.

The capsule is believed to include a collection of silver and copper coins dating from between 1652 and 1855; an engraved silver plate; newspapers; the seal of the Commonwealth; cards; and a title page from the Massachusetts Colony Records, according to Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance.

After hours of work, Pam Hatchfield, a conservator at the Museum of Fine Arts, dislodged a time capsule from the cornerstone of the State House.

Hatchfield, who is head of Objects Conservation at the Museum of Fine Arts, said the corroded copper alloy box that holds the collection was undamaged by the removal process, and appeared to be in good shape. It was a little smaller than a cigar box and, she said, heavier than she expected.

The box was taken by State Police escort to the Museum of Fine Arts, where Hatchfield said it will be X-rayed to determine the contents. There was some concern, Galvin said, that there may be some damage to some of the coins, which may have been washed in acid before the box was reburied in 1855.

“It will be opened probably sometime next week,” said Galvin. The contents will be examined, he said, but the time capsule will not remain unburied. “Ultimately it will be put back in the box and ultimately back in the stone.”

Galvin said officials have not yet decided whether they will add any objects to the capsule before re-burying it. The capsule was discovered during the course of a water infiltration investigation at the State House, which identified the corner where it was hidden as an area of concern.

It is believed to be one of the oldest time capsules in the state, according to Kelly. In October, a century-old time capsule was opened after it was removed from its perch in the head of a golden lion statue that had sat atop the Old State House in downtown Boston. Its contents included sealed letters, photographs, and newspaper articles in near-perfect condition.

On Thursday, excavation of the State House time capsule began at about 9 a.m., with workers unwedging the stone block from the corner of the building and propping it up on blocks of wood so Hatchfield could slide underneath. The block was not flipped upside down, said Hatchfield, because she did not want to risk dislodging any of the contents.

From about 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Hatchfield tapped away at the block, taking periodic breaks to warm up away from the whipping wind and snow. Workers brought her a space heater. The plaster that sealed the box in, she said, was much harder than she anticipated.

As she worked, tiny coins fell out of the plaster. During the 1855 reburial, public officials threw the coins in for good luck. Michael Comeau, executive director of the State Archives, said they appeared to be silver.

As the day wore on, Hatchfield used a small circular saw and a drill to try to free the capsule, and several times, she appeared to think she was close, only to have the box remain stuck. It was the most physically challenging conservation job she has ever done, she said.

“I have been privileged to spend all of my working life handling incredibly precious and important objects, and it is very exciting every single time,” said Hatchfield. “The sense of continuation of history that you get by entering a museum or historic site, but also by having it in your hands, is incredibly rewarding and enriching. And it gives meaning to a lot of people.”"

The Guardian reports that the woman was sleeping on the floor while the autonomous roving vacuum did its job.

But disaster struck when her hair became trapped in the mechanism after the machine mistook it for dust.

Fortunately the 52-year-old woman from Changing City was able to get help in time.

The woman was immediately woken by the pain, and called the local fire department with what the Yonhap news agency reported as a “desperate rescue plea”.

She was eventually separated from the machine by paramedics and was not seriously injured. Reports say she lost ""about 10 strands"" of hair.

South Korean newspaper Kyunghyang Shinmun did not report on the specific brand of vacuum involved - though another local news source said that since sleeping on the floor is more common in the country, people may be at more risk from robotic disaster.

Inevitably thoughts here will turn to the inevitable automaton uprising - but since the other other violence known to have involved a robot vacuum is one act of suicide, we probably don't have too much to worry about."

A 21-year-old woman claims to have paid $20,000 to surgically add a third breast in a desperate bid to become a reality TV star.

Jasmine Tridevil, not her real name, insists she was rejected by more than 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes before she found a willing surgeon who would perform the procedure.

Now, she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, Florida, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman.

Three-breasted? Jasmine Tridevil, 21, claims she paid $20,000 to have a third breast surgically attached to her chest. She is now filming her own reality show about the struggles she faces as a three-breasted woman

Surgeons are reluctant to perform unnatural procedures as the ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.'

Tridevil claims she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the operation on the grounds that she kept their name a secret.

The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate.

And she has proudly declared that she been disowned by her mother and sister, who ran out the room in disgust when they saw what she had done.

'My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me,' Tridevil said.

'My dad… he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.'

However, Tridevil insists she has no regrets as she prepares to send pilot episodes of her self-produced reality show titled Jasmine's Jugs to MTV.

'My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,' she told Real Radio 104.1.

'I'm dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn't work, I'm through.'

From left to right, Fatima, Seema and Reza Gul battled for seven hours against Taliban forces after they attacked a police checkpoint, manned by Reza's son

'I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon,' Gul told TOLO News. 'I went to the check post and began shooting back.'

Her daughter-in-law Seema added: 'The fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons. We were committed to fight until the last bullet.'

She added that the combats zone was strewn with Taliban bodies when the fighting was over.

A spokesman for the Afghanistan's Ministry of Interior told the agency it was a symbol of a public uprising.

The Taliban is yet to comment about the incident.

Alongside other insurgent groups, the Taliban have escalated attacks across the country since the withdrawal of most of the US led forces from the country last month.

Targeting, government, security and foreign installations, especially in the country's capital Kabul, members of the public have also been caught in the crossfire.

At least 50 people were injured earlier this week, when a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest in a crowd watching a volleyball tournament at an inter-district competition in Yahyakahil, Paktika province.

The attacks have prompted Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani to order a comprehensive review of the country's defense forces.

He is also rethinking Afghan policy towards controversial night raids, banned by his predecessor Hamid Karzai.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered a top-to-bottom inspection of his country's military forces after a rise in Taliban attacks

Ghani is considering whether night raids, barred by his predecessor Hamid Karzai, should be reintroduced

The latest attacks come as it was revealed US President Barack Obama signed a 'secret' order allowing the Pentagon to continue to target Taliban fighters even after the military withdrawal.

The president's decision, made during a White House meeting with national security advisers, also gives the military the green light to conduct air support for Afghan operations when needed.

Obama issued the guidelines in recent weeks, as the American combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close, thousands of troops return home, and the military prepares for narrower counter terrorism and training mission for the next two years.

Afghan lawmakers have also approved agreements with the US and NATO allowing Western soldiers to remain in the country.

The international combat mission in Afghanistan, which began after the 2001 US-led invasion that toppled the Taliban, was due to conclude at the end of this year"
133,"An Indian bride has married a guest at her wedding after her groom-to-be had a seizure and collapsed.

Reports said the groom, Jugal Kishore, was epileptic and he had kept the information from the bride, Indira, and her family.

While Mr Kishore was taken to hospital, the angry bride decided to switch husbands.

She asked a member of her brother-in-law's family, who was a guest, to step in and marry her instead. He agreed.

The incident took place in Rampur town in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.

According to a report in The Times of India, Mr Kishore, 25, fell to the ground in front of the wedding guests just as he was reaching out to garland Indira.

On his return from the hospital, Mr Kishore pleaded with Indira to change her mind, telling her that he would be ridiculed by friends and relatives if he went home without a bride, but she refused.

Local police official Ram Khiladi Solanki told the BBC that Mr Kishore and his family were initially upset and lodged a complaint with the police.

""But since the bride is already married now, what can anyone do? So the families have resolved the matter and the complaint has been withdrawn,"" he added."

145,"Apple has multiple versions of its upcoming smartwatch. This we already know. And while we don’t know the specific price points of each model, the consensus is that the Watch Edition will be the most expensive of all three thanks to its 18-karat gold casing. Though the Apple Watch Sport will cost $349 USD when it launches, the Edition is rumoured to cost thousands of dollars.

Apple is used to selling expensive merchandise in its stores, but the Watch Edition is different to anything else the company has sold, and it will be modifying its stores appropriately. According to 9to5Mac, Apple will be implementing some new security measures to ensure the watches aren’t stolen while they’re sitting in the store or when people are trying them on.

Sources are quoted as saying there will be special safes for the Edition. These will be equipped with MagSafe connectors to keep the watches charged and will house inventory during the day as well as the show floor demo models overnight.

Perhaps most interesting of all is that Apple will reportedly also have scales that employees will use to weigh the watches before they’re sold. This is not for the customer’s bragging rights but so Apple will know whether customers returning their watches are returning all of their watches.

Tim Cook confirmed last week that the Apple Watch will start shipping in April. Previously the device was thought to be launching sometime in March."
158,"Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.

The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.

Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.

The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.

The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.

Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.

Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.

The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.

Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.

Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.

This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.

In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.

In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning."
178,"The legendary Hewlett-Packard reportedly is about to become two companies.

One will focus on the firm’s personal computer and printer business, and the other on its business hardware and services, according to a story in today’s Wall Street Journal.

The publication, citing “people familiar with the matter,” said the split may be made public as early as tomorrow.

The Journal said that current CEO Meg Whitman will become CEO of the enterprise-oriented company, and independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman. Whitman will serve as chairman of the PC/printer firm, and exec Dion Weisler will be CEO.

HP has been struggling with its dual selves of being oriented toward businesses’ high-end needs and toward personal computers and printers. Various company executives have in the past discussed spinning off its PC unit, only to be followed by the company asserting its long-term interest in PCs.

In 2000, Agilent Technologies split off from HP, taking with it the test and measurement equipment business that was HP’s first line of business.

The company had long reigned as the top PC maker in the world, although it dropped to second place last year in the rankings of industry research firm IDC, after Lenovo. Its printer/personal systems group rakes in about $56 billion in fiscal 2013, about half the company’s total, but sales are down about seven percent from the previous year.

186,"The sound of 10 or 11 shots from the gun of Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson being fired at Michael Brown were recorded by a man in an apartment near the Aug. 9 shooting, according to the man’s attorney who shared the audio with CNN.

The network aired the recording Monday but has not verified its authenticity.

The 12-second audio begins with a man seemingly leaving a message for someone on an adult video service.

Six shots fired in rapid succession are heard in the background. After a two second pause, another four or five shots ring out.

Lopa Blumenthal, the unnamed man’s attorney, told CNN that her client has been interviewed by the FBI.

“At the time he didn’t even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,” Blumenthal said. “It just happened to have captured twelve seconds of what transpired outside of his building.”

While it is difficult to clearly make out whether 10 or 11 shots are fired, Blumenthal told CNN she believes she heard 11.

Details surrounding the recording are unclear, including why it is emerging over two weeks after the shooting.

It is also unclear at what point the man began recording the message that captured the gun shots. Witnesses as well as law enforcement officials have said that Wilson fired one and perhaps two isolated shots in his police cruiser before numerous shots were fired outside of the car. The new audio seemingly does not capture the one or two shots fired inside Wilson’s cruiser.

Wilson has reportedly claimed that the gun went off in the cruiser during an altercation with Brown in which the 18-year-old shoved him into the car, assaulted him, and struggled to grab the weapon.

After the altercation in the car, witnesses say that Brown fled. From there, Brown’s movements and Wilson’s response are also unclear.

Wilson reportedly claims that after pursuing Brown, the man turned around to face him, taunted him and then began charging before Wilson fired the fatal shots.

Some witnesses say that Wilson began shooting after Brown fled. At that point Brown turned around in order to surrender but Wilson continued firing the fatal shots anyway, the witnesses said.

In a press conference shortly after the shooting, St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar said that Wilson fired “more than just a couple [of shots]” but provided no further detail.

According to a CNN report filed days after the shooting, witnesses claimed that they heard up to 10 shots. Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown’s who was with him during the shooting, told of only a few.

A medical examiner who performed a private autopsy on Brown determined that he was shot at least six times. He had eight wounds on his body, but two may have been re-entry wounds.

It was initially reported that the altercation and shooting followed an argument after Wilson ordered Brown and Johnson to get out of the middle of the road. But it later emerged that Brown had stolen cigars and shoved a store clerk just minutes before he encountered Wilson. Wilson reportedly says that seconds after their first encounter, he received the police dispatch call reporting the strong-arm robbery and then doubled-back to confront the two.

222,"Thousands of students and activists gathered in the city's financial district in protest of anti-democratic leaders

Officers used tear gas and baton charge to break up crowd, but many protesters remain and have set up camp

Beijing last month ruled out open nominations for candidates for the first democratic election in Hong Kong in 2017

Protesters chanted 'Shame on C.Y. Leung', the city's Beijing-backed leader, while shielding faces from the gas

HSBC and Standard Chartered shut bank branches in Hong Kong as Hang Seng stock market fell to two-month low

Chinese riot police were forced into an embarrassing back down today as they withdrew from the streets of Hong Kong amid fury over their heavy-handed use of tear gas to disperse anti-democracy protesters.

Tens of thousands of people, mainly students, have brought central Hong Kong to a standstill, blocking roads and forcing the closure of banks and schools, in a major pushback against Beijing's decision to limit democratic reforms.

The uprising is fast becoming known as the 'Umbrella Revolution' due to the fact that protesters are using little more than parasols to protect themselves against the volleys of tear gas being fired at them by police - in an unprecedented crack down on dissent - leaving many choking under thick clouds of toxic vapour.

The protesters have in turn countered with the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture, first employed last month by demonstrators in Ferguson, Missouri, as they marched over the police shooting of unarmed black teenager Mike Brown. There, the gesture became a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America.

'Hands up, don't shoot': Protesters have responded to the government's use of tear gas by using the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture first employed by demonstrators in Ferguson, Missouri, last month as they marched over the police shooting of unarmed black teenager Mike Brown

Toxic fumes: Fury continues to grow over the police's heavy-handed attempts to disperse protesters, including the widespread use of tear gas

Appropriation: Protesters in Hong Kong have appropriated the gesture, which came to symbolise the fight against racism and police violence in America, as a symbol of democracy and freedom

Their use of the gesture has been hailed as a sign of how 'plugged in' to world affairs Hong Kongers are despite the mainland government's attempts to stifle social media and other information-gathering tools

And this morning, the Chinese government announced that riot police had been taken off the streets as citizens 'have mostly calmed down' and urged people to unblock roads and disperse.

Instead, the government switched its focus to social media, banning Instagram across the country in a further bid to stifle dissent in the Asian financial hub.

The popular photo-sharing service was shut down today in an apparent attempt to prevent demonstrators sharing photographs of the upheaval with their countrymen, as they expanded their rallies throughout Hong Kong.

Many photos already posted on the image-sharing website - labelled under the hashtag #OccupyCentral, a phrase officials went on to block from Weibo, China's version of Twitter.

Resistance: Thousands of protesters are still gathered in Hong Kong's financial district despite police throwing tear gas at them and launching a baton charge

Heavy-handed: Many photos already posted on the image-sharing website - labelled under the hashtag #OccupyCentral - show police firing tear gas canisters into crowds leaving protesters choking under thick clouds of toxic vapour

The social media crack down comes as police officers tried to negotiate with protesters, some wearing surgical masks and holding up umbrellas to protect against tear gas, camped out on a normally busy highway near the Hong Kong government headquarters that was the scene of impassioned clashes that erupted the evening before.

An officer with a bullhorn tried to get them to clear the way for the commuters. A protester, using the group's own speaker system, responded by saying that they wanted Hong Kong's Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying to demand a genuine choice for the territory's voters.

'Do something good for Hong Kong. We want real democracy!' he shouted.

As the mayhem continued, London-based banks HSBC and Standard Chartered were today forced to shut bank branches in Hong Kong as the territory's political unrest spills into the financial markets as the Hang Seng stock market to fall 2 per cent to a two-month low.

Meanwhile, the Foreign Office confirmed it is carefully monitoring the situation with a spokesman saying the British Government was 'concerned' about the events there and highlighted people's right to protest.

Protesters rest following pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. China has called the protests illegal and endorsed the Hong Kong government's crackdown

Nap time: Policemen rest following pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong after tens of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators brought parts of central Hong Kong to a standstill in a dramatic escalation of protests that have gripped the semi-autonomous Chinese city for days

He went on: 'It is Britain's long-standing position, as a co-signatory of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, that Hong Kong's prosperity and security are underpinned by its fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to demonstrate.

'It is important for Hong Kong to preserve these rights and for Hong Kong people to exercise them within the law.

'These freedoms are best guaranteed by the transition to universal suffrage.

'We hope that the upcoming consultation period will produce arrangements which allow a meaningful advance for democracy in Hong Kong, and we encourage all parties to engage constructively in discussion to that end.'

Hands up: Protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, adopted the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture after claims Mike Brown had his arms in the air when he was shot by a police officer in the city

Defiance: The clashes - images of which have been beamed around the world - are undermining Hong Kong's image as a safe financial haven, and raised the stakes of the face-off against President Xi Jinping's government

Anger: Beijing has taken a hard line against threats to the Communist Party's monopoly on power, including clamping down on dissidents and Muslim Uighur separatists in the country's far west

Force: The authorities have threatened to increase their use of force if the student activists, who are demanding democratic elections, do not disperse

Disruption: The protest marks the end of a week of activities which has become the worst unrest in Hong Kong since Britain handed the province back to China

Hong Kong police rained tear gas on thousands of pro-democracy protesters in the city's financial district today as tensions over the island's democratic rights grow

Gas: Officers used tear gas to break up the protest for the first time in Hong Kong since 2005, though officers denied rumours they had also fired rubber bullets

China has called the protests illegal and endorsed the Hong Kong government's crackdown. The clashes - images of which have been beamed around the world - are undermining Hong Kong's image as a safe financial haven, and raised the stakes of the face-off against President Xi Jinping's government. Beijing has taken a hard line against threats to the Communist Party's monopoly on power, including clamping down on dissidents and Muslim Uighur separatists in the country's far west.

The mass protests are the strongest challenge yet to Beijing's decision last month to reject open nominations for candidates under proposed guidelines for the first-ever elections for Hong Kong's leader, promised for 2017. Instead, candidates must continue to be hand-picked by Beijing - a move that many residents viewed as reneging on promises to allow greater democracy in the semi-autonomous territory.

With rumours swirling, the Beijing-backed and deeply unpopular Leung reassured the public that speculation that the Chinese army might intervene was untrue.

'I hope the public will keep calm. Don't be misled by the rumors. Police will strive to maintain social order, including ensuring smooth traffic and ensuring the public safety,' Leung said. 'When they carry out their duties, they will use their maximum discretion.'

Democracy: The students are demanding a free vote in upcoming elections after the Chinese government hand-picked candidates loyal to the regime

Protection: Protesters wearing home-made gas masks and goggle throw tear gas grenades back at police as they demand democratic elections in Hong Kong

Unlawful: Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung has said authorities will do whatever is necessary to break up the protest, which he said were illegal

Violent: An officer holding a riot shield shouts at protesters during a second day of demonstrations in Hong Kong where police have clashed with activists

The protest has been spearheaded largely but student-age activists but has gathered momentum among a broad range of people from high school students to the elderly.

Protesters also occupied streets in other parts of Hong Kong Island, including the upscale shopping area of Causeway Bay as well as across the harbor in densely populated Mong Kok on the Kowloon peninsula. The city's transport department said roads in those areas were closed.

More than 200 bus routes have been canceled or diverted in a city dependent on public transport. Subway exits have also been closed or blocked near protest area. Authorities said some schools in areas near the main protest site would be closed.

Leung urged people to go home, obey the law and avoid causing trouble.

'We don't want Hong Kong to be messy,' he said as he read a statement that was broadcast early Monday.

Arrests: While police have dispersed many of the protesters there are still thousands from the Occupy Central group gathered in the city's financial district

Protest: It is believed that the city's financial district will try to operate as normal tomorrow, despite thousands of protesters camped in the street

Crowd control: Riot police prepare to defend the Hong Kong government complex, although it was later reported that some protesters had made it inside

Standoff: Protesters have now erected barricades in the centre of Hong Kong and are preparing to settle in for the night as riot police surround them

Unrest: The night of demonstrations follows on from clashes between activists and police yesterday when students charged through a cordon and broke into the Hong Kong government complex

That came hours after police lobbed canisters of tear gas into the crowd on Sunday evening. The searing fumes sent demonstrators fleeing, though many came right back to continue their protest. The government said 26 people were taken to hospitals.

To ward off tear gas, demonstrators improvised with homemade defenses such as plastic wrap, which they used to cover their face and arms, as well as umbrellas, goggles and surgical masks.

The protests began with a class boycott last week by students urging Beijing to grant genuine democratic reforms to this former British colony.

'This is a long fight,' business and law student Edward Yau, 19, said overnight. 'The government has to understand that we have the ability to undo it if they continue to treat us like we are terrorists.'

When China took control of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, it agreed to a policy of 'one country, two systems' that allowed the city a high degree of control over its own affairs and kept in place liberties unseen on the mainland. It also promised the city's leader would eventually be chosen through 'universal suffrage.'

Hong Kong's residents have long felt their city stood apart from mainland China thanks to those civil liberties and separate legal and financial systems.

Beijing's insistence on using a committee to screen candidates on the basis of their patriotism to China - similar to the one that currently hand-picks Hong Kong's leaders - has stoked fears among pro-democracy groups that Hong Kong will never get genuine democracy.

University students began their class boycotts over a week ago and say they will continue them until officials meet their demands for reforming the local legislature and withdrawing the proposal to screen election candidates.

Students and activists had been camped out since late Friday on streets outside the government complex. Sunday's clashes arose when police sought to block thousands of people from entering the protest zone. Protesters spilled onto a busy highway, bringing traffic to a standstill.

In a statement issued after midnight, the Hong Kong police said rumors that they had used rubber bullets to try to disperse protesters were 'totally untrue.'

Police in blue jumpsuits, wearing helmets and respirators, doused protesters with pepper spray when they tried to rip metal barricades apart.

Thousands of people breached a police cordon Sunday as they tried to join the sit-in, spilling out onto a busy highway and bringing traffic to a standstill.

Although students started the rally, leaders of the broader Occupy Central civil disobedience movement joined them early Sunday, saying they wanted to kick-start a long-threatened mass sit-in demanding Hong Kong's top leader be elected without Beijing's interference.

Occupy Central issued a statement Monday calling on Leung to resign and saying his 'non-response to the people's demands has driven Hong Kong into a crisis of disorder.' The statement added that the protest was now 'a spontaneous movement' of all Hong Kong people.

Police said they had arrested 78 people. They also took away several pro-democracy legislators who were among the demonstrators, but later released them.

A police statement said the officers 'have exercised restraint and performed their duties in a highly professional manner.' It urged the public to not occupy roads so that emergency vehicles can get through.

Among the dozens arrested was 17-year-old Joshua Wong, who was dragged away soon after he led a group of students storming the government complex. Wong is a leader of the activist group Scholarism, which organized protests two years ago that forced the government to drop proposed Chinese national curriculum guidelines seen as brainwashing. He was released Sunday evening.

225,"The Indian government has sacked a civil servant who went on leave in 1990 and never came back to work.

Urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu said a case of ""wilful absence"" had been proved against electrical engineer AK Verma.

Mr Verma had been under investigation since 1992, but had refused to co-operate, the minister said.

Correspondents say absenteeism is a pervasive problem in government-run offices in India.

Mr Naidu said in a statement that Mr Verma joined the Central Public Works Department in 1980.

He had risen to the rank of executive engineer by 1990, when he went on leave.

An inquiry was set up in 1992, but formal proceedings to dismiss him were not begun until 2007.

It took a further seven years for the department to reach a decision and dismiss him.

It is not clear whether he was paid during his time off.

Falling absenteeism

India's bureaucracy has become notorious for high levels of absenteeism.

A report in 2012 labelled India's government machinery the worst in Asia.

Schools have also faced problems, with teachers failing to turn up for work in huge numbers.

Last August, a state school in Madhya Pradesh sacked a teacher who had been absent for 23 years of her 24-year career.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to curb slack working practices when he took office last year.

The AFP news agency reports that he makes unannounced visits to government offices, and absenteeism has since plummeted."
228,"Sex-selecting abortions are nothing new. They happen all the time in China, for example. While they undoubtedly happen in the United States, people don’t brag about them. At least they didn’t.

It’s hard to believe this is real, but according to the website “Injustice Stories,” a woman named Lana, a self-described feminist, boasted of aborting her baby because it was a boy. Then, after making that declaration, claims to be shocked that some people might have a problem with that.

Lana, who only uses her first name, appears to be a child of privilege. She boasts of involvement in “fighting for women’s rights” being all-consuming, “even to the point of eschewing a career.” Yet that lack of a career hasn’t stopped her from travelling to “many different places” to continue that “fight.

She tells the story of a flight to an Occupy Wall Street event in San Francisco where she screamed “Assault” because the man sitting next to her said “B******* like you need to learn their place.”

Putting the unlikeliness of that exchange aside, Lana then demanded to be moved to another seat. That’s when she was told the only empty seats were “both back in economy.” At which point she demanded the man be moved.

When the flight attendants came running, one of whom was male, they refused to force the man to move because he hadn’t done anything. Lana, regretfully, relented and, in tears, moved herself.

The encounter left her “having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.”

That flight, according to Lana, left her forever changed. “By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause,” she wrote.

Lana was pregnant at the time, and thought she “had a good idea” who the father, or as she puts it, “the donator” happened to be. She was convinced she was having a girl because, well, she wanted a girl. Or at least a baby with a vagina, the “gender” part would be up to the child. “I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become,” she writes.

After researching all-girl daycares and schools with the plan to make sure that “No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names,” Lana got horrible news from her doctor – her baby had a penis.

She spent the next two days in fit of crying rage. How could this happen to her? She says, “My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden.”

Within a few days she had aborted the baby. “My body’s betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong,” Lana claims. “I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good.”

Lana informs readers that she is now the mother of “a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother.”

She ends her post with:

I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.

I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.

The backlash was immediate, and harsh. Lana, much to her shock, was on the receiving end of negative comments and even death threats.

At the request of the editors of the website, Lana returned to answer critics. She was as unrepentant the second time as she was the first."
231,"Joan Rivers' doctor took a selfie with the unconscious comedian in the operating room before her endoscopy, according to a new report from CNN. The ear, nose and throat specialist, who hasn't been publicly identified, was also allowed to perform a biopsy on her vocal cords, a procedure that Rivers hadn't previously approved and which may have led to her cardiac arrest.

Citing ""a source close to the death investigation,"" CNN reports that the doctor was allowed into the operating room at Yorkville Endoscopy, although he wasn't affiliated with the clinic in any way. While there, the source added, he ""took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia."" After Dr. Lawrence Cohen, medical director of Yorkville, finished performing the procedure on Rivers, he stepped aside and allowed the ear nose and throat specialist to biopsy her vocal cords. During that procedure, CNN says, her vocal cords ""began to swell,"" cutting off oxygen to her lungs and leading to her cardiac arrest.

Yorkville Endoscopy previously released a statement denying that Rivers' vocal cords were being biopsied  when she went into cardiac arrest. The statement didn't address reports that Rivers' personal doctor was allowed in the operating room. Yorkville's medical director, Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was performing the endoscopy on Rivers, has already stepped down from his position. Neither he nor Rivers' doctor have been accused of any wrongdoing by the state Health Department officials investigating Rivers' death.

244,"A Catholic priest from Massachusetts had been dead for 48 minutes before he was miraculously resuscitated. However, it is his description about God that is bound to spark a hot debate about the almighty.

Father John Michael O’Neal was officially declared dead for more than 48 minutes, but medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. According to the 71-year-old man of God, the supreme entity isn’t a man, as is popularly assumed and believed. Father O’Neal claims he met God during the brief time he was officially dead and God is a woman.

The catholic father claims God is a warm and comforting motherly figure. The revelation will undoubtedly have a profound bearing on the teachings of Christianity, which firmly believes and even implies that God is a male figure who has watched over us with love and devotion. Though the love and devotion part is corroborated by Father O’Neal, he differs from the church’s teachings about the gender of God.

Father John Micheal O’neal had the chance to meet with the divine when he was rushed to a hospital late last month owing to a massive heart attack. However, Father O’Neal was declared clinically dead shortly after his arrival. Not one to give up hope so easily, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital kept the blood flowing to his brain with the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2.

While the blood flowed with the help of modern science, doctors worked tirelessly to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm. Consistent with near-death experiences, Father O’Neal entered heaven through a gate made of bright light and encountered God. However, instead of the all-mighty father figure, the priest claims he was warmly greeted by a motherly figure. Father O’Neal describes the divine entity as “mother-like ‘Being of Light.'”

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting. She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

As expected, the priest’s claims about the gender of God has created quite a stir amidst devote Catholics. The intense discussion between the catholic clergy of the archdiocese about the “experience” of the father and the ramifications of his revelations persuaded the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

Though his superiors have disapproved, Father O’Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother.”

“I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

Given the potency of Father O’Neal’s alleged experience, it is quite likely he might face some resistance and criticism. However, he is prepared, assures the priest.

247,"The 41-year-old is believed to be dating 29-year-old Olympic swimmer Micheal Phelps

Taylor Lianne Chandler was born David Roy Fitch circa 1973.

While she was given a male name she is actually intersex which means she had male genitalia but no testicles.

At the same time she also has a uterus and no ovaries.

From a young age she knew that she was in fact female and started to dress as a girl.

Facebook   Taylor Lianne Chandler

In her teens she used testosterone blockers and estrogen enhancers.

During this period her name was changed – she initially changed it to Paige Victoria Whitney.

She left home age 15 and by 16 she became legally emancipated from her family.

When Taylor was 18 she got in trouble with the police twice – for a bad cheque and then a DUI.

The following year she revealed she “thought it would be smart to blackmail someone” into giving her money for her surgery.

But as soon as she got the money she was arrested and charged for extortion.

Post by Taylor Lianne Chandler.

Taylor was forced to spend 30 days in jail – during which time she said she was ‘too ashamed’ to tell any of her family members.

Despite both her birth certificate and drivers licence proving she was female, she claims she was put in a cell with three men and was raped.

At some point in her twenties she underwent surgery to remove her male genitalia.

Since then she has campaigned for gender rights.

In 2001 Taylor was involved in an 'horrific' car accident which made her change her goals.

Facebook

Following a lengthy recovering period she returned to school to study sign language interpreting - and did a two year ITP.

She went on to get a degree in social and behavioural sciences.

In 2004 her dream of opening an online consignment shop came true when she launched Chandler's Designer Consignment.

By 2013 she had found her calling in life - working in crisis management and has consulted on numerous hight profile cases.

In August 2014 Taylor says she met Michael Phelps via the dating app Tinder and they stared to start.

On September 30 2014 her relationship with Olympian Michael was made public and she rose to prominence.

By that time she had fell in love with the swimmer who checked into rehab in September after being arrested for DUI.

Taylor found it was too difficult to continue interpreting after she was in the public eye.

Since telling him she was born intersex she is worried she will lose him.

On 14 November she announced on Facebook that she was an intersex baby.

277,"According the latest in a string of scoops from 9to5Mac, battery life has been a pressing concern for Apple throughout the development of the Apple Watch. And for the first time, ""sources familiar with the Watch's development"" have provided some early figures on what consumers can expect when the device ships sometime this year. In short, Apple Watch will exhibit similar longevity to what we've seen from many Android Wear devices on the market today.

Apple was originally shooting to eke out an entire day of battery life from Apple Watch. Obviously that's not all active use; in fact, the company is said to be shooting for 2.5 to 4 hours of active application use with the screen turned on. That'll vary depending on how heavily you use it, of course. But since the wearable's display will often be turned off throughout the day — and because the iPhone handles a lot of computing tasks — Apple is apparently hopeful that the watch can make it from morning until you place it back on the wireless charger at night. 19 hours of combined active and passive use seems to be the bar as of right now.

THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE TO EXTEND A SMARTWATCH'S BATTERY LIFE

This isn't unlike what you'd get from the current field of Android smartwatches; use them constantly and they won't last a day. But that changes with more average use. Notably, the Pebble smartwatch continues to blow away the field in terms of battery life, but it's a very different device when compared against a Moto 360 or the Apple Watch. In standby and low-power modes, 9to5Mac's sources say Apple Watch can last through two or three days. And if for some reason you want to use it strictly as a timepiece and leave the screen on at all times, it'll die out after three or so hours. Using it as a workout companion? Your gym routine shouldn't last more than four hours.

Apple is reportedly testing Apple Watch's battery life aggressively — and in large numbers. 9to5Mac claims the company has distributed over 3,000 units as the development process continues. And while the iPhone is a critical companion to Apple Watch, the device itself may be more powerful than some expected. 9to5Mac says the CPU inside is more or less equally as powerful as the A5 chip that powered the iPhone 4S and iPad 2, and remains in the current-generation iPod touch. Considering the tiny form factor, we're expecting the same fluidity and responsiveness that have become hallmarks of iOS. But as for the battery, Apple can only do so much. The simple fact is that battery technology doesn't evolve at nearly the same rate as the smartphones in our pockets and wearables on our wrists. The company will undoubtedly keep pushing for improvements as Apple Watch's launch nears; it's expected to ship beginning in March."

According to the New York Post , a fisherman in Russia was attacked by a brown bear, but was able to escape death when his Justin Bieber ringtone went off and scared the bear.

Igor Vorozhbitsyn, 42, was heading toward his favorite fishing spot in Russia’s Yakutia Republic when a bear started clawing at him, according to The Austrian Times .

The man told the news agency that his granddaughter had downloaded the hit song “Baby” onto his phone as a joke. As funny as the joke may be, it was lifesaving when his phone rang during the attack and Bieber’s melody scared the bear.

According to the report, the man said the bear halted the attack and fled back into the forest.

The man said he “couldn’t believe” his luck.

According to wildlife experts who spoke with The Austrian Times, a “sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks” as the ringtone was a “very unexpected sound for a bear”.

306,"An Egyptian man named Abu Obeida al-Masri has reportedly fled to Turkey with more than $1 million belonging to ISIS.

Obeida was secretary of the Zakat bureau and treasurer of the ISIS Syrian branch before fleeing with the money, notes the IBTimes UK. The amount he stole reportedly reached one billion Syrian pounds.

According to the Hidaya Foundation, Zakat is an obligatory act that has to be performed by every adult and able-bodied Muslim. It is an important pillar among the five pillars of Islam. Zakat is a part of the wealth and property that Muslims must pay annually, to help the poor of their community. One of the main purposes of Zakat is to keep those who are wealthy clean, monetarily, from sin. It is a form of Sadaqah (charity) which is obligatory for Muslims.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said ISIS ""has forced the merchants and industrialists to pay 2.5% of each sale.""

When the merchants told ISIS militants that they are already helping and supporting the poor families with money and aid, ISIS did not exempt them from paying the 2.5%.

""The money paid to the poor without reference to the Zakat Chamber is an act of charity, but it doesn't exempt traders from paying to the Zakat Chamber,"" they explained.

As a result of this incident, rumors claim that ISIS militants have issued an order to no longer recruit any Egyptian jihadists.

This financial blow to ISIS is not the only breaking news from the terrorist group as a recent video was released on Tuesday which showed Jordanian pilot al-Kaseasbeh being burned alive. This has sparked European and United States outrage against the terrorist group.

Jordanian officials have sworn vengeance against the Islamic State terrorist group for murdering al-Kaseasbeh. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has also issued a statement condemning the brutality and violence that ISIS has repeatedly shown against humanity.

“ISIL is trying to build this overarching caliphate through which there is no diversity of thought, of religion, values or culture,” says Gianni Pittella, member of the European Parliament. “The fact remains that ISIL is a very pernicious entity.”

317,"Joan Rivers' cardiac arrest may have been triggered by an unauthorized biopsy that the comedian's personal physician — who apparently took a selfie in the operating room — performed on Rivers' vocal cords, CNN reported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources close to the investigation.

The 81-year-old Rivers was at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in Manhattan for a scheduled endoscopy by gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen to diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat. A source told CNN that after Cohen completed the procedure, which involves putting a camera down the throat, Rivers' personal physician — an unidentified ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic — stepped in to perform the vocal-cord biopsy, corroborating an earlier report by the Daily News.

CNN also reported that an unnamed clinic staff member told investigators that the personal physician took a selfie in the room while Rivers was under. CNN's source also said neither the gastroenterologist nor the ear, nose and throat doctor had been accused of wrongdoing.

A procedure such as a vocal cord biopsy requires patient consent and would only be authorized to take place in a hospital setting. The clinic released a statement last week saying no such biopsy was performed on Rivers, and declined to respond to CNN's report, citing federal privacy laws.

However CNN's source said investigators are focusing on the biopsy and believe her vocal chords started swelling after the physician made a spur-of-the-moment decision to remove a growth with a scalpel. The swelling may have cut off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which could have triggered cardiac arrest, according to CNN and the Daily News.

Rivers suffered cardiac arrest on Aug. 29, and died a week later at Mount Sinai Hospital.

318,"Apple originally planned for the Apple Watch to have a whole range of exciting health-tracking features, but the company had to cut many of them before its anticipated release this April, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The Apple Watch was meant to feature a system to track how stressed you are by measuring the conductivity of skin. You sweat more if you're nervous, and that makes your skin more conductive.

The Watch also included an electrocardiogram feature that measures a user's heart rate (that's more in-depth than simply measuring a pulse). But Apple couldn't get the health-tracking features to work in the way it wanted. It found that people with hairy arms or dry skin had trouble using the health monitors. And the watch didn't work properly on people who wore it too loosely around their wrist.

Other features that didn't make it into the final Apple Watch were blood-pressure and blood-oxygen-level tracking, according to The Journal. Those would have been tricky for Apple to include because providing medical advice or guidance from that data comes under the regulation of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in the US. We do know, however, that Apple secretly met with the FDA in 2013 to find out which features would come under the agency's regulation.

Apple was forced to cut the advanced health-tracking features from the Apple Watch because it simply couldn't get them to work. That doesn't mean that it isn't going to add them back in future versions of the device, though.

Elsewhere in its article, The Journal says the Apple Watch was known at Apple by the name ""black hole"" because it kept drawing in more and more resources. Development of the device reportedly took over four years."
341,"THE ISLAMIC State is bankrolling its terror operations by harvesting organs, the UN Security Council has been told.

Dozens of bodies have been discovered with surgical incisions as well as missing kidneys and other vital organs, Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations Mohamed Alhakim briefed a security council.

The corpses were found piled up in shallow, mass graves over the last few weeks.

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim yesterday urged the UN Security Council to investigate the allegations of organ harvesting.

""We have bodies. Come and examine them,"" he said.

""It is clear they are missing certain parts.""

Ambassador Alhakim claimed a dozen doctors were ""executed"" by the Islamic State in Mosul, in northern Iraq, for refusing to harvest organs for the terror group.

Mosul, which was seized by Islamic State militants in June last year, is the third largest city in Iraq and home to more than a million people.

The Iraqi ambassador also accused the Islamic State – also referred to as IS, ISIS and ISIL – of ""crimes of genocide"" by targeting certain ethnic groups.

Nikolay Mladenov, the outgoing UN envoy to Iraq, reported that 790 people were killed in the country by terrorism and armed conflict in January alone.

Mr Mladenov confirmed there have been an increasing number of reports of ISIS using organ harvesting to finance part of their operations.

But he said that ""it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day.""

The black market for human organs is growing rapidly, revealed a major investigation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2012.

Some 10,000 black market operations involving human organs take place each year across the globe – more than one an hour.

Desperate patients will pay gangs more than $200,000 (nearly £128,000) for a kidney, WHO concluded.

""There is a growing need for transplants and big profits to be made. It's ever growing, it's a constant struggle,"" Luc Noel, a doctor and WHO official, told The Guardian.

""The stakes are so big, the profit that can be made so huge.""

Islamic State currently hold a third of Iraq and neighbouring Syria – imposing strict Sharia law.

""Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,"" Mr Mladenov added.

Earlier this week, Iraqi prime minister Haider Abadi confirmed plans are underway to liberate the city of Mosul.

""I'm pretty sure that we can liberate Mosul with the minimum of casualties and costs,"" Mr Abadi said.

The news of Iraq's show of force against Islamic State in Mosul came hours after Egyptian media reported killing '64 jihadists' in a series of aerial assaults launched as a retaliation for the beheading of 21 Egyptians at the hands of ISIS extremists.

Egyptian warplanes bombed Islamic State targets in Libya including weapon storage sites and training camps.

Pope Francis denounced the merciless beheading – branding it a ""barbaric assassination"".

352,"A former American soldier from Wisconsin who has become the face of the YPG Kurdish military force in Syria, told UPI Wednesday in an exclusive interview that civilians have been burned in an Islamic State attack, with injuries consistent with chemical weapons.

Jordan Matson, 28, a former U.S. Army soldier speaking from Derik, Syria, said his information comes from Walat Omar, the head field doctor in the embattled border town of Kobane, which is encircled by IS militants. Matson and others in the area said the injuries were caused by chemical weapons.

""Since I got the phone calls here in the location... I looked into it myself and after I'd seen pictures from fighters... from Kobane, I contacted the local field doctor on the ground in Kobane and he had sent me many pictures from the hospital,"" Matson said in his first video interview with U.S. media.

""We're trying to get a video camera to Kobane because they don't have one right now to record the injured and show the world proof of what's going on over there. ... We're making more attempts to have more solidified proof for the rest of the world.""

Omar posted photos to Facebook of visible burns that were reportedly sustained in the overnight attack.

Matson, a native of Sturtevant, Wisconsin, arrived in Syria last month via Iraq and quickly became the public face of the YPG.

""Someone had to do it,"" he said, laughing.

He is more serious in the widely publicized image of him clad in camouflage, a head scarf and carrying a weapon now appearing across YPG's social media accounts. Although the public role ""was thrown on me,"" Matson is quick to add he's happy to play it because the media attention has ""brought light to the situation here.""

Matson says American veterans are ""outraged"" over the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.

""We do not want to see our brothers' lives be for nothing,"" he said. ""So, in the hundreds, veterans are lining up to come over here because if our government won't do anything, we will.""

Matson acknowledged that the recent U.S. airdrops of Iraqi-provided weapons to YPG fighters in Kobane are helpful in the battle against IS, but that more is needed.

On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked to explain U.S. support to non-vetted local fighters in Syria.

Earnest said that while there is ""limited insight into those particular fighters... the fact is, at this point, they are working hard to defeat ISIL forces that right now are concentrated on this specific community.""

""So we're going to evaluate each of these circumstances as they come along to look for opportunities to support local fighters against ISIL,"" Earnest said.

Matson said YPG needs more weapons and night vision goggles. The Islamic State militants, he said, fight primarily under cover of darkness and engage with YPG within 300 meters.

Night vision goggles ""would give us the ability to see them coming, organize our defenses and engage the enemy, and force ISIS to fight us at day because we would have a larger advantage.""

On Tuesday, the YPG launched a recruitment campaign. ""JOIN People's Defense Units/YPG/in Rojava, Syria, SEND TERRORISTS TO HELL and SAVE HUMANITY,"" reads the YPG's 'Lions of Rojava' recruitment message.

The page profiles American fighters, including Matson, who have traveled to Syria to join the battle against IS.

Matson encouraged his Facebook followers to consider joining the YPG, directing those interested to visit the newly established YPG recruitment page: ""For all those looking to join the YPG... send them a private message. They will explain what you need for your journey and will organize travel arrangements for you. Thank you all for your patience and god bless.""

It's unclear how many Americans are now overseas but Matson said Wednesday there are ""hundreds.""

Neither the U.S. Army nor the Pentagon would comment on the travel of former veterans to Syria.

The YPG has identified two other Americans who have joined its defense forces. Brian Wilson of Ohio, and Jeremy Woodard, a former infantryman from Mississippi.

Wilson declined to be interviewed.

Woodard's brother, Allen, expressed frustration with Jeremy's decision to travel to Syria. In a public Facebook post last month, he wrote:

""I talk to him almost everyday and still don't really understand why the hell he did go over there but he is there now and nothing I can do about it now. I just hope he makes it back fine. I think the military failed him this time. He never got the war and stuff out of him and the VA's mental health didn't keep a watch on him... His reasoning and excuses for going over there just don't make sense at all."""
358,"A wicked aunt cut her three-year-old nephew’s penis off when he burst in on her on the loo and asked to use her phone.

Xue Paan, 37, was sending text messages to her boyfriend while sitting on the toilet when toddler Qiang Qiang walked in and asked if he could play a game on her mobile.

But instead of giving him the phone, the fuming aunt went into the kitchen, picked up a knife and severed the boy’s penis while his mother was visiting a next-door neighbour in Luohe, a city in central China’s Henan Province.

Horrified mum Cai Tuan, 27, said: “I had popped out to see a neighbour and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream.

“I ran back to the house and couldn’t believe what I saw.

“Qiang Qiang had fainted and was lying in a pool of blood.

“Next to him was a knife and his penis.

“It was simply horrific.

“My sister, his aunt, had gone.”

Qiang Qiang was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach the penis and was then sent to a specialist clinic in the capital Beijing.

A hospital spokesman said: “Unfortunately, the knife was quite blunt and the cut wasn’t clean so although we reattached the boy’s penis, it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment.

“However, he has now had three surgeries all of which have been successful and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.”

A police spokesman said: “The aunt was arrested and admitted attacking the boy because she was angry that he had interrupted her on the toilet.”

362,"ELON, N.C. – A recent rumor claims that Elon University has banned the term “freshman” because it’s sexist. But the rumor is not true, according to the university.

A junior student at Elon University recently wrote an article for the College Fix, a website for students, claiming the school dropped the term and replaced it with “first year.”

The post claims it was an official move made by the school this fall to promote inclusivity, diversity, and ensure the campus does not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students. The National Review Online also picked up the story.

The article claimed the school implemented the term “first-year” in everything from its website to orientation workshops.

But Dan Anderson, vice president of university communications at Elon, told the Burlington Times-News there is no ban or new policy.

Anderson said the university uses the term “first-year” because it applies to more students than the term “freshman.”

He said the school uses “first-year” to describe any student in the first year at Elon, as opposed to a recent high school graduate.

“Elon has done what most schools have done and gone to using ‘first-year’ more frequently because ‘first-year’ encompasses more than just traditional freshmen,” Anderson said. “We still use ‘freshman’ when it refers to traditional students who come right out of high school.”

The student who wrote the original story said she became curious when she was writing a story for the school newspaper and her editor changed the word “freshman” to first-year.”

She said she was surprised her story got as much attention as it did and hopes it didn’t put the school in a bad light.

He is, however, the commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Air Force. The king is a trained combatant, part of the parachute brigade and flies civilian planes and helicopters, the official added.

Doocy quietly corrected he record at the end of the next segment. “By the way, I should point out we understand that so far the king has not taken part in any of the raids,” Doocy said. “But he may going forward.” What a statement that would make.

388,"Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, now attracts coins, spoons and glasses to him - and had decided to become a superhero when he is older

A boy who was almost killed when he was knocked out by a huge electrical shock claims he has become a LIVING MAGNET with superpowers like those of Marvel's Magneto.

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, was blasted across the pavement when he leant briefly against a lamppost that was live from a faulty wire.

""When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened,"" he said.

""When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body.

""Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.""

Europics   'Superpowers': Nikolai Kryaglyachenko wants to be a superhero when he grows up

Nikolai said he was a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, had decided to put it to the test.

""I can do things I couldn't do before but I don't have a lot of control over it,"" he said.

""Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things.

""Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me.""

Nikolai added that he has now decided instead of a fireman he wants to be a superhero when he is older, saying that he would want to do something that helped people, and the job would certainly fulfil that role.

Europics   Look at me: Nikolai Kryaglyachenko 'performs' for his classmates

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers, and Nikolai even claims that he seems to be able to share his power.

According to his classmates, he can influence others so that other people turn into live magnets as well.

Nikolai's classmate, Vika Balandina, said: ""I could even hang a ladle on my nose.""

Stories about ""living magnets"" began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century.

In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Europics   Cutlery collection: Nikolai Kryaglyachenko is a magnet for spoons and coins

Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as ""magnets,"" many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body.

Only some of them develop a ""preference"" for a particular material.

In 1990, as many as 300 ""living magnets"" gathered for a conference in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV.

The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm.

Scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic, it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin.

393,"Justin Bieber recently saved the life of a 42-year-old Russian man.

No, the Biebs didn’t do anything heroic. When Igor Vorozhbitsyn was en route to his favorite fishing spot in northern Russia’s Yakutia Republic, he was attacked by a huge brown bear.

But then, his cell phone rang and the ringtone, “Baby,” scared off the animal.

As the bear started clawing violently at Vorozhbitsyn, the Biebs’ pre-pubescent vocals made the bear’s ears bleed, and it ran off.

Wildlife experts believe it was the fact that the ringtone sounding off was so unexpected that it spooked the bear, but it’s more fun to say the bear just really, really, hated that song.

Vorozhbitsyn suffers from severe bruises on his chest and face and cuts on his neck. Other fishermen found him after he was attacked, and used his phone to call for help.

Vorozhbitsyn says he knows the ringtone “isn’t to everyone’s taste,” but it was his granddaughter that loaded “Baby” onto his phone “for a joke.”

I think, however, that’s just code for “I’m honestly just a true Belieber.”

398,"(CNN) -- Could a newly released audio provide more clues on what led up to Michael Brown's shooting death?

The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson, Missouri, police on August 9, the man's attorney told CNN.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

""I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired,"" the man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN's Don Lemon. ""And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.""

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, his attorney said.

He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

The attorney said she learned of the man's recording late last week from a mutual friend.

""I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,"" Blumenthal said.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.

The meaning of the pause

It's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' ""

Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown's death.

Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.

According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a friend of Wilson said Brown mocked the officer and charged at him before the shooting began.

An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown's body.

Will autopsy shed any light on what happened?

Key witness speaks out

Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting.

And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put Johnson's credibility in question.

In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.

Johnson said Monday night he doesn't understand why some are questioning his credibility.

""I see they bring up my past, my history, but it's not like it's a long rap sheet,"" Johnson told Lemon. ""This one incident shouldn't make me a bad person.""

405,"Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary was known as 'L Jinny' as a rapper

Saturday 23 August 2014

A former rapper fighting with the Islamic State (Isis) in Syria is believed to be one of several British jihadists under investigation following the beheading of James Foley.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 24, was known as L Jinny or Lyricist Jinn at home in London, where his rising music career saw him appear in videos and have his singles played on BBC Radio in 2012.

He came to national attention earlier this year, when he posted a picture of himself holding a severed head on Twitter after resurfacing in Syria.

The gruesome picture, believed to have been taken in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa, was captioned: “Chillin’ with my homie or what’s left of him.”

Bary reportedly travelled to the country last year from Maida Vale, west London, where he lived with his mother and five siblings.

His father Adel Abdul Bary, an Egyptian refugee thought to be one of Osama Bin Laden’s closes lieutenants, was extradited from Britain to the United States on charges of terrorism in 2012 for his alleged roles in the bombings of two US embassies in east Africa in 1998.

His family is frequently mentioned in rap songs that are still floating around the internet, with many people, unaware of L Jinny’s macabre transformation, praising his lyrics.

In early songs put online in 2012, Bary makes apparent reference to drug use, violence and life on a council estate and talks about the threat of his family being deported to Egypt.

“It’s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,” he rapped in 2012.

“I’m trying to change my ways but there’s blood on my hands and I can’t change my ways until there's funds in the bank.

“I can’t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart’s disintegrating. I ain't got normal feelings.

“Even my life’s blessed, still I will not find rest.”

In later songs, apparent references to cannabis (“roll up and watch the leaves ignite”) stop and are replaced with tirades against people who choose to spend their money clubbing, drinking and on drugs rather than feeding their families.

Many British jihadists are known to be in Syria, including these men featuring in an Isis video to urge Islamists in the West to join them  The most recent video, which was posted on YouTube in March this year, is called “The Beginning”.

“Give me the pride and the honour like my father, I swear the day they came and took my dad, I could have killed a cop or two,” Bary raps.

“Imagine then I was only six, picture what I’d do now with a loaded stick. Like boom bang fine, I’m wishing you were dead, violate my brothers and I’m filling you with lead.”

Bary’s current whereabouts in Syria is not known and his Twitter account under the name “Terrorist” @ItsLJinny has been deactivated.

Previous posts mentioned Abu Hussein al Britani, a fellow Isis militant who has uploaded pictures of himself on Twitter with guns in Syria.

He and associate Abu Abdullah al-Britani were seen offering travel advice to would-be jihadists online earlier this year.

The Sun newspaper has linked the trio to a group of British jihadists known as “The Beatles”, including the man known as “John” who beheaded American journalist Mr Foley.

In pictures: James Foley

A sound expert who compared the footage of the brutal killing with Bary’s rap songs told the paper there was a “big likeness” between the voices.

Mr Foley’s murderer has not been identified by authorities but the Foreign Secretary said he sounded British and experts were urgently trying to trace him.

Police are believed to be preparing for raids on several homes across Britain in efforts to trace “jihadi John” but a spokesperson for the Counter Terrorism Unit at Scotland Yard would not confirm the identities of any suspects."

The report, which cited unidentified industry sources, said LG Display will be the sole supplier of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens for the Apple Watch that go on sale in April.

Samsung Display will also become a supplier for the next version of the smartwatch that is expected to go on sale either sometime in the second half of this year or early 2016, the South Korean newspaper said.

LG Display and Samsung Display declined to comment on the report. Apple could not be immediately reached for comment.

Apple has scheduled a special event on March 9, where it is expected to showcase Apple Watch. The Apple Watch, which will let consumers check their email, pay for goods at retail stores and monitor personal health information, represents Apple’s first major new product introduction since the 2010 launch of the iPad."
414,"While Apple has yet to publicly announce a specific launch date for the Apple Watch beyond ""Early 2015"", sources speaking to 9to5Mac say the company is currently planning for a March debut in the initial wave of countries. Sources in the retail segment indicate that select store employees will undergo centralized Apple Watch training the week of February 9, with those employees in turn training others at their individual stores in the days leading up to the device's launch.

One or two representatives from many Apple Stores in the United States, depending on store and market size, will be sent to Apple offices in either Cupertino, California or Austin, Texas to learn first-hand about the Watch. These training programs will take place between February 9th and February 16th.The report indicates Apple has been continuing to refine various aspects of the Apple Watch since its September unveiling, focusing mostly on software but also tweaking such components as the inductive charging mechanism.

Developers are currently working with Apple's WatchKit tools and iOS 8.2 betas to build apps for Apple Watch, starting with lightweight Glances, actionable notifications, and iPhone-based apps that project portions of their interfaces to the watch. More powerful apps running directly on the Apple Watch will be possible later this year.

416,"WASHINGTON (CBS DC) – Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., says that at least ten fighters for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have been apprehended while attempting to enter the southern U.S. border.
The California Republican claims that “at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” in a conversation with Fox News on Tuesday. Hunter says that the Islamic terrorists are slipping into the U.S. through the porous southern border as several have already been captured.
“There’s nobody talking about it,” Rep. Hunter told Fox. “If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border. It’s that simple…They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol.”
In August, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, warned that the open border posed an “immediate threat” for terrorist activity infiltrating the country. The government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, said ISIS terrorists were “planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.”
Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that the 1,933-mile southern border with Mexico is the obvious entry point for Islamic State terrorists. He says that information regarding the capture of Islamic State terrorists crossing the border comes directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
“ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border – which they already have,” he added.
“They aren’t flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,” said Hunter. “But they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico…All you have to do is ask the border patrol.”
The Department of Homeland Security released a statement on Wednesday that claims alleging Islamic State militants have been apprehended at the Mexican border are “categorically false.”
“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”
After Hunter’s comments to Fox, one of his sources nuanced their claims, saying that some of those apprehended at the border might be ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army – one of many ISIS enemies.
In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Hunter said he was not backing down on the claims.
“The Congressman was conveying what he knows — and what he was told,” the spokesperson told ABC. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing — it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

418,"VENICE BEACH, Calif. --You've probably heard Apple is launching its latest i-device, a new Apple Watch, in April and that it will start at $350.

But did you know there are three editions of the watch? What no one knows, outside of Apple, is how much the top of the line ""Watch Edition"" will sell for.

We've seen online reports that it could sell for as much as $4,000. Maybe more.

So we got to wondering: How much would consumers pay for the top-of-the-line Apple Watch?

Not much, as we recently found out in chats with consumers here.

""I'd get the $350 model,"" says Ashlea Fellows of Australia. ""I wouldn't go any higher.""

Thousands of dollars for a gold watch? Not for Karla Gallegos of Chile. ""Too expensive. I could find a watch made of gold for $2,000,"" she said.

Juan Frias of New York would drop $1,000. ""I like gold watches,"" he says. ""I'm a teacher, and I wouldn't have to look down at my wrist. My daughter texts me, I can look and nobody can say, `Hey, you're on the phone.'""

Apple touts the high-end Apple Watch as sporting a 18-karat gold case, which it says is twice as hard as standard gold. And it's protected by sapphire crystal, advertised as almost impossible to break, unlike the gorilla glass of the iPhone.

In mid-2014, many analysts expected Apple to use sapphire glass on the iPhone 6, but that didn't happen. Apple wasn't happy with the sapphire being produced by its factory near Phoenix, which has since been shut down. The company hasn't said where its new sapphire is being produced.

Estimates online for how much Apple will charge for the top-line watch are all over the map. Website Grail-watch.com goes as high as $10,000. ""t's pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size,"" notes the site.

But even at $4,000 or $5,000, the price tag will make it easily the most expensive item at the Apple Store. It's most expensive computer, the MacPro, starts at around $3,000.

Apple's high-priced watch will be in good company -- and even if it tops the most optimistic estimates, it will be still be way cheaper than the gold standard of luxury watches, the Rolex. Amazon's Rolex page starts at $4,000 and goes all the way up to $62,000.

But those watches don't read back texts or control your music.

With such expensive i-jewelry on display at shopping malls across the world, will it change the way people shop at the Apple Store? Will folks be wary of walking out of the store with a multi-thousand-dollar gold watch on their wrists?

Paul Wallace of Long Beach, Calif., admits that sporting a gold Apple watch on his wrist would make him a target. ""It would….but you've got to go Gold,"" he said. ""If you've got it, flaunt it.""

474,"Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured.

Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page.

The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story ""mere propaganda"". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible.

Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting.

Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north.

Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet. A link will be added in the comments if the story is officially confirmed or denied.

493,"Kim Jong-un: Not deposed, just having ankle surgery. Photo: AFP

Tokyo: Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumours ranging from a stroke to a coup d'etat, is apparently just recovering from ankle surgery.

Mr Kim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.

""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,"" the source said, adding that the leader had had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world's most impenetrable country, that rumours spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.

Nevertheless, it is true that Mr Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong-il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, causing speculation about his health.

But the gossip mill started up again last week when Mr Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since September 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. The rumours went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the ""Great Successor"" was in an ""indisposed condition"".

""Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,"" said the narrator of a documentary called Improving the Lives of the People, showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month.

Outside commentators have guessed that Mr Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.

Weibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice-marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China's official papers, ran a commentary on Monday titled: ""For those who make up rumours of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?""

The unauthenticated audio was recorded by a man who says he was taping a video chat conversation when the shooting of the unarmed black teen by a white police officer occurred around noon on Saturday, Aug. 9.

CNN said it could not independently verify the authenticity of the audio. The man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, said that her client discussed the tape with the FBI. The FBI has yet to comment on whether it questioned the man who made the recording.

A CBC News still shows Vickers holding the gun and walking through the House of Commons' moments after taking down the assailant.

Vickers has been the House of Commons' head of security since 2005 and will now go down in history as one of its most memorable after he bravely pursued and took down Zehaf-Bibeau.

Despite working for the RCMP for three decades, relatives said the incident was the first time in his career that Vickers had ever shot anyone.

Riveting video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons on Wednesday makes startlingly real just how heart-thumpingly dangerous the situation was that Vickers heroically diffused.

A rush of armed police can be seen running toward an unseen suspect as the video from Globe and Mail opens.

At the head of the pack is a man moving swiftly with his gun in hand toward Zehaf-Bibeau, who had moments before murdered a reservist who stood guard at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown soldier.

The death of that man, a 24-year-old father of a young son, Nathan Cirillo, would soon be avenged as Vickers takes aim inside the cavernous parliamentary building and fires off multiple shots.

As those shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover.

Inches from disaster: The terrifying morning attack happened just outside the MPs' caucus rooms

And like that, it was over. Vickers had brought to a close the terrifying scene of senseless violence in mere moments of professional poise.

'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott.

Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred.

'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.

Vickers has honed his peacekeeping skills over a prestigious 28-year career as a member Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

And peacekeeping is the word. According to his brother, Wednesday's showdown was Vickers' first exchange of gunfire with a suspect in his nearly three-decade long career.

'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'

His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'

Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.

A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.

Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.

'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.'

On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke.

Vickers - already back in work - was greeted by a standing ovation from parliament. Humbly nodding his head, the police veteran received handshakes from leading politicians.

'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said.

'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'

Earlier in the morning, a man was arrested for getting too close to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen as they placed flowers at the scene of the shooting.

Armed officers ordered the unidentified man to the ground for 'disturbing the crime scene' after he was warned not to cross the crime tape but did.

On Wednesday evening Harper addressed his nation from an undisclosed location and condemned the horrific actions but vowed his country's foreign policy would not be thrown off course.

'Canada will never be intimidated,' he said.

Queen Elizabeth released a statement to the country saying she was saddened by the events.

'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected' she said.

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in.

Arrest: An unidentified man was arrested for disturbing the crime scene as security concerns are still high across Ottawa

Chilling footage appears to have caught the moment that gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau got into a hijacked car moments after shooting a soldier dead at Ottawa's War Memorial.

Footage from a dashcam appears to show the Muslim convert climb into the driver's side of a Toyota Corolla that - according to witnesses - he had stolen earlier.

Zehaf-Bibeau stormed the Parliament minutes later having abandoned the car in the street with the engine running after he had driven a short distance from the cenotaph.

A shoot-out with armed officials ensued, with Zehaf-Bibeau eventually shot dead by Vickers as shocked politicians and journalists barricaded themselves in rooms and cowered in corridors.

One eye witness said that as many as 30 shots were fired in the exchange, which took place just yards away from where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking.

The 32-year-old had callously shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, in the stomach at point-blank range while he was on ceremonial duty.

Despite the desperate efforts of medics, Mr Cirillo succumbed to his injuries in hospital.

A witness told The Ottawa Citizen that he'd seen a man armed with a double-barrelled shotgun wearing a scarf 'hijack a car'.

He added: 'It was pretty intense.'"

The App Store's 'Top Apps' lists are well known to the smartphone-savvy public, but how apps make it into those lists is perhaps less understood. Today, one micro-blog shared photos under the heading ""It's Hard Being a Top App Worker,"" publicly exposing the operations behind App Store rank-boosting (Ed: which I henceforth dub 'crank-boosting') labour. 

The exposé, shown in the picture, displays a 'Top App list worker' in their work place, which features a simple shelf containing hundreds of iPhone 5Cs. In a room filled with such workstations from one side to the other, mobile phone labour takes place at an industrial level. Simply put, a worker downloads (and deletes and downloads, etc.) an app to boost its rank on the App Store, calculated by how many times the app has been downloaded. One worker can operate as up to 100 unique users. 

Apple has previously adopted measures to deter crank-boosting in order to ensure fair rankings for developers and users. In 2014 November, Apple introduced a 1 yuan strategy to drop the threshold for users to download apps, also intended to negatively impact the crank-boosting industry. 

But as crank-boosting simulates genuine user activity, it is nearly impossible to detect or safeguard against. 

Users accustomed to comparing and contrasting apps before download may be unknowingly swayed by crank-boosted apps that have purchased their celebrity. Such sneaky, industrious operations are tricky to break."

CBI files case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh over forced castration IANS
The agency filed case against the Dera Sacha Sauda chief on Wednesday on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons and criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code, following an order by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
Hansraj Chauhan, a former Dera follower, had filed a petition in the high court in 2012 alleging that he along with around 400 male devotees of the Dera were castrated inside the ashram on the orders of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.
Disposing off the petition, the high court had ordered a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the case in December 2014. The court asked the CBI to file the first status report by 2 March.
Chauhan had demanded a CBI inquiry and compensation for the castration inside the ashram in 2000. Chauhan claimed that the castration of Dera followers was done by the chief through doctors employed in his hospital.
Chauhan said in his petition that he along with other devotees was castrated under false claims that they would be able to realise god through the Dera chief after their castration.
Haryana Police handed over the documents related to the incident to the CBI on 2 January. Haryana Police also provided documents related to seven other devotees of the Dera chief who also claimed to be castrated.
 

The Dera has dismissed the castration allegation. Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who is making his film debut with ""MSG: The Messenger of God"", is also facing trial in connection with cases of murder of a journalist and sexual exploitation of his women disciples."
520,"The Islamist militant group Boko Haram has agreed to a ceasefire and the release of more than 200 kidnapped school girls, according to Nigerian officials. The girls were abducted six months ago from a school in Chibok.

Nigerian government officials claimed on Friday to have struck a two-part deal with Boko Haram, including a ceasefire and the release of 219 school girls, whose abduction last April sparked international outrage.
""Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,"" said Hassan Tukur, who represented the Nigerian government at talks with the militant organization in neighboring Chad. ""They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,"" he continued
The girls have been missing for the past six months, despite international efforts mobilized by the Twitter hashtag campaign #BringBackOurGirls to rescue them from captivity. France, Great Britain and the United States have helped with the search for the girls, while China, Israel and other nations have also provided various forms of assistance.
Nearly 300 girls were kidnapped from a boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok on April 14, but dozens managed to subsequently escape. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has been criticized by the girls' families for responding slowly to their abduction.

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates to ""Western education is sacrilege,"" seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Shariah law in northern Nigeria. During its early years, the Sunni militant group engaged in isolated skirmishes with Nigerian security forces. But after a bloody government crackdown in 2009, Boko Haram launched a broad insurgency. Last summer, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau declared a calipate in the areas under his forces control.
Boko Haram's insurgency has been characterized by a brutal campaign of bombings and shootings targeting Christian churches, Muslim mosques, schools, markets, bars, villages, police stations and even a UN building. An estimated 5,000 Nigerians have been killed and a further 300,000 displaced by the violence.
In 2013, the Nigerian government declared a state of emergency in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa. Amnesty International has accused the Nigerian military of war crimes, including extrajudicial killings, in its fight against Boko Haram. The United Nations and Human Rights Watch have also alleged that Nigeria's security forces have committed human rights abuses.
Nigeria's population of 177 million people is 50 percent Muslim and 40 percent Christian. Muslims are concentrated in the north and Christians in the south. The remaining 10 percent of the population practices indigenous beliefs.

526,"Boston| 
A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father O’neal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isn’t a female.

A holidaymaker was left horrified after discovering a tropical spider had burrowed underneath his skin during a trip to Bali.

The 21-year-old Aussie was abroad with friends when he discovered the strange red trail stretching two inches across his stomach.

Dylan Thomas was told by doctors at the Bali International Medical Centre that he was suffering from an allergic reaction to an insect bite and was sent away with some antihistamine cream.

But three days later, when the red mark began to blister, and almost double in length, Dylan knew there was something wrong.

After going back to the medical centre to see a dermatologist, health professionals were shocked to discover that a tropical spider was burrowing just below the surface of his skin.

Doctors managed to extract the spider from Dylan's abdomen and revealed that the insect had buried itself into the scar from his recent appendix removal.

""It was a bit bigger than the size of a match head,"" said Dylan about the creature.

552,"Computing giant Microsoft is one of the Silicon Valley companies that has hired robot security guards to protect and serve the streets around northern California's technology hub.

The Knightscope K5 robot security guards are fitted with lasers, GPS and heat-detecting technology, and can predict where criminals will strike next and the likelihood of future crimes.

Unlike human security guards, the egg-like Knightscopes are not armed(Knightscope)

The 5ft tall robots are designed to operate without human control and are equipped with surveillance cameras and sensors, a thermal imaging system, scanners that can read 300 car registration plates a minute, and odour detectors. It patrols the streets using lasers to gauge distance and a GPS system.

The robots analyse information from government, businesses and social media sources to predict the likelihood of a crime being committed in a given area, and decide whether the alert authorities it if comes across anything suspicious.

Four of the robot security guards have been deployed to guard Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus, in the system's first real mission.

It appears to be going well, although the robots have come unstuck in the face of a seemingly innocent adversary: steps.

Rachel Metz, a reporter for MIT Technology Review, said: ""I noticed that a K5 in the distance had somehow toppled over the edge of the sidewalk onto the parking-lot asphalt several inches below. A couple of Knightscope folks were needed to pull it upright.""

554,"Swiss cheese, Cuban heels and a gruelling political schedule have been blamed for Communist leader's injury

Video loading

North Korea dictator Kim Jong-un has undergone a hospital operation after he fractured both ankles.

The 20-stone leader of one of the world’s most impoverished countries has soared on the scales due to his love of fine wine and dining.

Kim, believed to be aged 31, is under armed guard by his personal protection team at a hospital in North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang.

One source in South Korea’s Seoul said there had been a marked increase in elite officials visiting the ward after Kim’s official car did not appear to have left Pyongyang in recent weeks.

Kim is believed to have sprained then fractured his ankles during a gruelling tour of military bases and factories in shoes with Cuban heels to give him a little more height and a physical appearance of more authority.

Painful: Kim Jong-un is believed to insist on wearing Cuban heels for official duty to appear more of an authoritarian

The 31-year-old leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while studying in Switzerland and imports vast quantities despite Western sanctions.

One intelligence source said: “He has become noticeably overweight since he came to power.”

Kim was seen limping when he visited a government establishment in a clip shown on North Korea’s Central TV.

There were earlier suggestions Kim’s obesity and binge drinking had brought on gout which confined him behind closed doors for several days.

But aides were determined to turn his health problems to good advantage, with the official Rodong Sinmun daily newspaper saying he had “laboured on” by visiting various facilities in the hot summer weather.

Kim even missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang last Thursday fuelling belief he was still confined to hospital.

Craving: The North Korean leader's love of cheese has led to rapid weight gain

A Seoul government official said it was unlikely “a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People’s Assembly just because he has gout.”

His absence from the assembly was followed by a rare admission by state TV, which not only showed footage of him limping but also stated that he was ill.

A team of doctors from Europe is also believed to have travelled to North Korea recently.

A political observer said ""coming down closer to the level of his people"" was the only way Kim was going to return to health, beat his gout, lose weight and prevent a repeat of his reported fractured ankles.

Malnutrition is widespread in North Korea, with famines often breaking out in a country still relying on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s.

562,"Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices, saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349, analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands.

Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers — Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition — each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices.

Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options.

The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.

On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.

Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.

""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.

He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band — assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 — the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.

The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.

Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event, as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.

AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week."

572,"As a feel-good video of a generous homeless man continues to touch and move millions around the world, a California man has come forward to claim that the Internet prankster behind it faked a significant portion of the film, confirming our earlier suspicions.

In the video released last week, YouTube star Josh Paler Lin purports to give a homeless man named Thomas $100 and then secretly follow him around to see how he spends it. Thomas walks right into a liquor store. But instead of alcohol, the homeless man defies expectations and walks out with a couple of bags of food, then heads to a nearby park and starts giving it away to other people down on their luck. Apparently moved by the selfless act, Lin confronts Thomas and tells him that he’s being filmed.

Uploaded By: JoshPalerLin

As of Tuesday morning, the video had racked up more than 27 million views on YouTube and inspired more than 150 glowing news articles from around the world. Following its success, Lin launched an Indiegogo fundraising campaign to “help Thomas get a fresh start,” which has netted more than $127,000 in well-meaning donations from the public.

But now a nursing student from Anaheim has come forward to say there’s no way Thomas could have been secretly filmed—because he and Lin arrived at the liquor store in the same car. “The whole thing is bullshit,” says Taugan Tan Kadalim, who claims that on Dec. 20 he was outside the Euclid Liquor & Market, where the video’s pivotal scene is set. “Thomas knew he was being followed.”

The 26-year-old says he stopped at the store to buy a lottery ticket before picking up his girlfriend, who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street. As he was walking out of the liquor store, Kadalim says he spotted Lin sitting in the driver’s seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, it’s him,” says Kadalim, adding that he subscribed to Lin’s YouTube channel. “I couldn’t believe it.”

A cameraman sat in the passenger seat of Lin’s car, and behind him was the man who Kadalim would later recognize as Thomas, the homeless Samaritan Lin claims was secretly followed with a hidden camera. Thinking the three men were about shoot a prank video, Kadalim decided to stick around and watch.

What Kadalim says happened next is sure to disappoint many of the millions of viewers who have been touched by the video.

YouTube

According to Kadalim, Lin hopped out of the car, went inside the liquor store and spoke with the cashier. While the two men chatted inside, Thomas waited with his bag by Lin’s car. Eventually, the prankster returned to his car, and a few minutes later, Thomas wandered into the liquor store. Several calls to Euclid Liquor & Market to confirm Kadalim’s account went unanswered.

“That was the last thing I remember seeing,” Kadalim says.

In the actual video, Thomas appears to be followed from a distance for several blocks, and as he enters the store, Lin says to his cameraman, “Keep filming. Make sure he doesn’t see you.”

Kadalim says he immediately fired off a text message about the sighting to his brother, a fellow YouTube prank enthusiast. He shared the text with Vocativ, and the date and time stamps appear to match up. Kadalim’s girlfriend, who spoke on the condition that we not use her name, also corroborates the account.

“He told me that he had just run into some famous YouTube star while buying a lotto ticket,” she tells Vocativ. “Don couldn’t wait to watch the video.”

But when Kadalim did see the video, released on Dec. 22, he was floored.

“Bro, he drove Thomas to the liquor store,” he says. “While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.”

Upset, Kadalim called his girlfriend and his brother to tell them what happened. As the video started to go viral just before Christmas, he posted a comment to Lin’s YouTube channel explaining what he witnessed. His words, however, were quickly buried beneath an outpouring of praise as thousands left comments in support of the video.

“I’m not frustrated because he’s helping a homeless man and people love this video,” he says. “I’m frustrated because it’s dishonest and exploitive.”

Prior to Kadalim’s revelation, Lin told Vocativ that not a single scene had been staged or scripted. “There is no way we’re making any of this up,” he said. “This is real.”

Subsequent attempts to reach Lin for further comment on Kadalim’s accusations were unsuccessful.

After the video went viral, Lin told us previously that he plucked Thomas from the homeless shelter where he’d been staying and put him up in a hotel, the name of which Lin would not disclose. Lin has also refused all media requests to speak with Thomas, and he denied repeated requests from Vocativ to make Thomas available for an interview. At the same time, he’s been busy producing more videos starring the homeless man, including this “Xmas Surprise Makeover,” released Sunday.

Uploaded By: JoshPalerLin

Lin also informed us that he has at least one more major media event in the works, in which he plans to surprise Thomas with all of the money that’s been raised for him on Indiegogo. Asked how the public could be certain those funds would actually go to Thomas, Lin told us that his lawyers, agent and manager have everything “covered.” When asked for the names of his lawyers, agent and manager, Lin refused to provide them, claiming they are “confidential.” He also declined to let any of them speak with Vocativ."

While Apple had announced that the Apple Watch would start at $350, which was widely assumed to be the price of the aluminum model, and estimates pegged the price of the gold Apple Watch at prices as low as $1,000 or as high as $5,000, there has been little information regarding the pricing of the stainless steel option.

The listing agent for Vladi Private Islands says the island, about an hour from Stockholm, features one golf hole in addition to a “mini mansion,” secluded villa, hunting lodge, private barber and landing strip for propeller planes. How convenient! 

“This island was owned by Tiger Woods,” the listing agent said, “but after his divorce he doesn’t need an island in Sweden anymore. This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy. … 

“The protected location, combined with the quay’s generous dimensions, make it an ideal place for private parties and outdoor dining.”

Interested? The price is only available upon request, but something tells us private islands don't come cheap."
614,"Batman as Steve Jobs? Sure. How about that guy from Superbad as Woz, too?
Seth Rogen has reportedly signed on to star as Steve Wozniak in the upcoming Steve Jobs film from Sony. You know, the as-yet-untitled biopic written by Aaron Sorkin, creator of ""The Newsroom"" and ""The West Wing.""
The comic actor would join Christian Bale, who is tipped to play Jobs, according to Variety.
Sony's flick would be the fourth such feature film that's either in the works or has already been made about Jobs, sharing the marquee with 2013's ""Jobs"" (the one with Ashton Kutcher), ""iSteve"" from the same year (the one made by Funny or Die), and 1999's ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"" (the one where the iPhone hadn't been invented yet). One might argue that the world is a bit Jobs'd out, but we suppose it depends on the strength of Sorkin's script and Danny Boyle's directing.
On the plus side, the film is based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the late Apple CEO—titled simply, ""Steve Jobs""—which was Amazon's best-selling book for 2011.
If you ask Sorkin, though, the movie isn't entirely biographical per se.
""It's not a biopic; it's not the story of Steve Jobs—it's something much different than that. He's a fascinating guy—part hero, part antihero,"" Sorkin said earlier this year, as reported by Mashable.
""I don't want to make any news or make anyone feel like I approached the movie in a different way. I'm going to make the movie speak for itself. But he's a fascinating guy surrounded by fascinating people, and he had very interesting relationships with the people in his life,"" Sorkin said in a separate interview.
Rogen isn't officially on board just yet, per The Hollywood Reporter, and it's unknown whether an official offer has been made or even if any kind of negotiations have taken place. Bale is supposed to be in the midst of negotiations to appear as Jobs.
Leonardo DiCaprio was first tapped for the role of Jobs, but dropped out earlier this month to take a role in ""The Revenant."" After that, DiCaprio plans to take a long break from acting, according to The Hollywood Reporter."
617,"Beats Music will eventually disappear as a brand, according to a new report. TechCrunch reports that Apple plans to eliminate the Beats Music streaming service, which it acquired in May, but doesn’t say when. The report is less clear on what Apple plans to do with streaming music. Once source tells TechCrunch that on-demand music could be integrated into iTunes; another source says Apple will make a “significant music announcement” in the first half of 2015.

Engineers from Beats Music have already been transferred to other divisions at Apple, including iTunes, according to the report. As TechCrunch notes, Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers was put in charge of Apple’s ad-supported iTunes Radio product in August and has been splitting his time between the services since then.

When Apple bought the Beats brand for $3 billion, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue called Beats Music “ the first music subscription service done right .” Though it mostly mimicked existing services from Spotify, Rdio, and others, Beats Music tried to differentiate itself through hand-curated playlists and the involvement of music-industry titans like Dr. Dre and Trent Reznor. But after three months it had only 250,000 subscribers, compared to  over 10 million  on Spotify. Still, Cue had positioned Beats as a key component of Apple’s music strategy, saying that the company wanted to offer on-demand listening along with ad-supported radio and digital downloads.
All of which suggests that while the Beats Music brand may be going away, on-demand streaming from Apple could easily take another form. If iTunes is remade as a kind of celestial jukebox that combines your MP3s and on-demand streaming into a single place, the Beats Music brand going away might not be such a bad thing, after all.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The male Shar-Pei crossbreed was discovered tied to a railing outside Ayr station on 2 January.

The suitcase included the dog's pillow, toy, food bowl and food.

The Scottish SPCA traced a previous owner through the dog's microchip but were told it was sold in 2013 to someone they did not have details for.

Inspector Stewart Taylor said: ""The dog is micro-chipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.

""We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013.

'Cruel incident'

""Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.""

Insp Taylor said the case highlighted the potential consequences of selling an animal online.

He said buyers often included people acting on impulse who knew very little about animals.

He added: ""Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible.

""If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.

""Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home.""

The charity reminded pet owners that abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006."

629,"9-year-old girl has written a hearfelt letter to her teacher, after he revealed he was gay during a lesson on homophobic bullying.


It reads: “Dear Mr R
“Even though you’re gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now. I still think about you the same way as I used to. You’re a great teacher and these are just some of the word’s (sic) that I would describe you as: great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.
“The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave.
“You don’t have to feel scared because I know that everone in the class feels the same way as I do.
“From A x x
PS. We are all proud of you”
The teacher told PinkNews: “As a primary school teacher I’d always worried about mentioning my sexuality, despite the fact that my colleagues talked about their husbands, wives and significant others all the time.

“Then, as part of anti-bullying week, I’d asked who’d heard ‘gay’ being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned.
“Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.
“After speaking to my Head, who was very supportive, we agreed I could tell the class that I’m gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they’re talking about me.
“The reaction was fantastic – there were a lot of gasps and shocked looks and some basic questions – do you have a boyfriend, etc – but after a couple of minutes they were over it and we moved on to the rest of the lesson.
“The letter came a couple of days later. The little girl who wrote it gave it to me at the start of the day with all the other slips about dinner money, school trips and doctors appointments.
“Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson, ‘It’s just your life’. Then she went back to her maths.
“For my class it was a surprise sure but, to them, it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgement, no follow up, just acceptance.
“Now, I can mention my fiance as easily as any other teacher and my class know me a little better. I’ve had a lot of letters and cards over the years, but this one I know I’ll keep forever.”"
641,"The ship left Sierra Leone on July 13 2014 in destination of the Mexican city of Tampico. Six days after leaving the port of Freetown, the captain of the ship reported in a radio communication that three of the crew members were beginning to show distressing symptoms that suggested they could be infected with ebola, and that the ship was changing course to head towards Cape Verde to get some medical help. This was the last time that the crew was heard of, and all 17 men on board are presumed to have died in only a few days later.

The ship could now pose an important threat to the American public, as the ship is believed to be infested with thousands of starving rats possibly carrying the ebola virus. Many of the witnesses who came across the ship over the last months, have indeed reported seeing the rodents feeding off the crew’s bodies as the ship went by. Experts fear that these animals could now spread the disease to humans and other animals on the continent, creating an uncontrolable ebola pandemic in the United States.

The ship is believed to be infested with thousands of ebola-ridden rats, fear local health authorities

The Guinean Luck has been reported multiple times in the Atlantic Ocean, drifting away slowly along the North Equatorial Current towards the American continent. It has been sighted almost a dozen times since November 2014, by various ships sailing north of the Antilles. It was last reported to have been seen by fishermen, only a few nautical miles North of the territorial waters of Bahamas.

Despite their efforts, the American authorities have not been able to locate the ghost ship, but some recent satellite pictures showing the ship have enabled them to narrow the search area to approximately 400 square nautical miles (nearly 1375 km² or 530 square mile). A total of 324 coast guard ships and 32 helicopters have already been affected to the search operations, forming the largest search force ever created by the U.S. coast guard.

Ships and officers of the U.S. Coast Guard from the entire East Coast have been mobilized in a desperate attempt to find and sink the ship before it reaches America.

Experts and analysts estimate that the ship’s actual course and speed will bring it to land or be washed ashore in Southern Florida over the next weeks, probably near the densely populated Miami area. The authorities remain confident however, that the ship will be found and sunk before it reaches the coast."
652,"The Apple Watch might have been four years in the making and the most Jony Ive-centric Apple product yet — but the company didn’t get everything it was wishing for from the device.

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Apple originally wanted its smartwatch to focus far more prominently on health-related innovations, only to be forced to go in another direction midway through the project.

If Apple had had its way, the Apple Watch would have boasted smart sensors capable of tracking blood pressure, heart rate and even stress levels — but despite hiring top people from the biosensor industry, the technology didn’t work quite as well as had been hoped.

Problems were apparently posed by Apple Watch wearers with hairy arms and dry skin, with sensor results also varying depending on how loosely or tightly the watch is worn. Despite a heavy drain on Apple resources, engineers were unable to create a suitable solution in time for the company to reveal the device.

As a result, the Apple Watch shipping in April will be far more of an iPhone accessory/companion than had originally been planned, which is no doubt useful for growing Apple’s interlocking ecosystem but is less good in other ways. Although Apple has the luxury of taking its time with products, yesterday’s New Yorker story reveals how much pressure there was to announce a new category of device post-Steve Jobs.

While there’s still a lot to be excited for, the health-tracking applications of the Apple Watch were ones that people are very excited about. Apple has already had success introducing HealthKit into top hospitals, and a medically approved wearable could potentially help grow relations between Apple and the healthcare industry.

In a recent interview, Steve Wozniak discussed health-tracking as one of the most potentially exciting features of the Apple Watch. Cult of Mac has also written about the potential of the Apple Watch becoming your “digital doctor.”

Sadly, it seems we’re going to have to wait at least a couple of generations before the technology can live up to that billing."

A video shared online made it seem as if Vladimir Putin got some unwelcome love from a feathered friend Sunday during a speech unveiling a monument to Russians who served in World War I.

Putin was speaking about the sacrifice made by Russian soldiers in World War I, linking the Great War to his own current political troubles. “This tragedy reminds us what happens when aggression, selfishness and the unbridled ambitions of national leaders and political establishments push common sense aside, so that instead of preserving the world’s most prosperous continent, Europe, they lead it towards danger,” he said. “It is worth remembering this today.”

704,"With Christian Bale already secured to play the lead in Aaron Sorkin's highly anticipated Steve Jobs biopic, Seth Rogen's has now been added to the list of potential cast-members.

The 32-year-old actor is reportedly talks to portray Steve Wozniak - who created the Apple I computer and co-created the Apple II computer in the 1970s - according to The Wrap.

Hollywood actress Jessica Chastain - who is currently starring alongside Matthew McConaughey in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar - is also being courted for a role in the film, simply entitled Jobs.

Return of the Mac: Seth Rogen, left, is reportedly in talks to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, right, in the upcoming Steve Jobs biography, Jobs

Slumdog Millionaire film-maker Danny Boyle is to direct from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who used Steve Jobs' authorised biography by Walter Isaacson.

The film - which will reportedly not be a traditional biopic - is expected to follow the late technology whiz during three stressful and high profile product launches throughout Apple's history.

While talking with Bloomberg on Thursday, 53-year-old Aaron Sorkin revealed that British actor Christian Bale would be playing the title role in Jobs.

A new Jobs: Christian Bale has been cast as the lead in Aaron Sorkin's upcoming Steve Jobs biopic

Based on the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson, Jobs will feature Bale, 40, in every frame of the film.

But that daunting acting task doesn’t worry Sorkin, who cast Bale without even an audition and called the Dark Knight trilogy star a ‘phenomenal actor’ during the interview.

If this all seems familiar, that is because another biographical film – with the same name – about Steve Jobs came out in August 2013 to a great deal of fanfare.

Another Steve: Ashton Kutcher played Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in the 2013 film co-starring Josh Gad

Starring Ashton Kutcher, 36, as Jobs, that movie chronicled the Apple co-founder’s career from college in the 1970s through the introduction of the iPod in 2001.

Christian’s version, in contrast, will focus mostly on three major speeches Steve Jobs gave during his career.

‘What we needed was the best actor,’ Sorkin said of Bale, who won an Oscar for his supporting role in 2010’s The Fighter (filmed between instalments of Bale’s Batman movies).

Winner: Despite years of critically acclaimed roles, Bale won his first Academy Award for The Fighter in 2011

Christian was again nominated for an Oscar for 2013’s American Hustle and has been a critically acclaimed actor since starring in Steven Spielberg’s Empire Of The Sun at 14.

Despite being best known as a superhero, Bale is known for physically transforming himself thoroughly between roles and thus should be fine to take on the more cerebral Jobs role.

Before his death in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, Jobs gained a reputation as an excellent speaker, in addition to his work in creating and then transforming Apple Computers.

It’s a big leap from Batman to Jobs, but if there’s one actor who can play both muscle-bound Bruce Wayne and skinny Steve Jobs, it is Christian Bale.

Chameleon: Bale tends to change his look between films, meaning this October 14 photo in Los Angeles is not likely to resemble the actor in Jobs"

It's a terrifying first-hand look at how close U.S. forces come to disaster each day as wars rage abroad.

'A Taliban sniper managed to get a non-fatal headshot on a Marine's helmet while the Marines were conducting a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district,' wrote Sam Arnold, who uploaded the video to YouTube.

According to Arnold, the sniper shot was part of a 'U-shaped ambush by insurgents.'

750,"Iraq has urged the United Nations to investigate Islamic State terrorists' bloody trade in human organs after the Iraqi ambassador said doctors are being executed for not harvesting body parts.

Mohamed Alhakim claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near ISIS stronghold Mosul over the past few weeks.

ISIS' horrifying trade in human organs, which was revealed by MailOnline last December, is just the latest way for the terrorist organisation to finance its activities, with other major sources of the group's $2 million-a-day income being the sale of oil, ransom payments, and smuggled antiques.

Lucrative: ISIS has set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market

Speaking of ISIS' organ harvesting operations, Mr Alhakim said: 'We have bodies. Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts.'

He also said a dozen doctors have been 'executed' in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.

Mr Alhakim briefed the UN Security Council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of 'crimes of genocide' in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing UN envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, also told the council that last month alone, 790 people were killed by terrorism and armed conflict in the country.

He also noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that IS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that 'it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day'. He used an acronym for the group.

Making them rich: Mohamed Alhakim claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near ISIS stronghold Mosul (pictured) over the past few weeks

Mr Mladenov said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized over the past year.

The Sunni militants currently controls around a third of both Iraq and neighbouring Syria and imposed its strict interpretation of Sharia law in its self-declared caliphate - subjecting a population of around four million people to a brutal campaign of rape and massacre.

'Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,' Mr Mladenov said, using an alternative acronym for the group known as ISIS in the West and Daesh in Arab nations.

The shocking news of ISIS trade in human organs was first revealed in a report by al-Monitor news website in December, citing an Iraqi ear, nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al-Mosuli.

He told the site that ISIS commanders hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in Mosul that is already beginning to generate huge profits.

Militants: Each of the letters is signed with a purple stamp, indicating the province from which it was sent. They are understood to have been handed to ISIS' network of messengers and fighters

The al-Monitor report also claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market.

'[Al-Mosuli] said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors,' the report's author wrote. 'Information then leaked about organ selling.'

The report went on: 'Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.'

Most of the organs are then smuggled out of Syria and Iraq into neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Turkey where criminal gangs sell them on to shady buyers across the globe, the Assyrian International News Agency reported.

While organ harvesting may be the most shocking of IS' revenue streams, the report highlights a string of others that contribute to the group's $2million annual income.

Intelligence chiefs are investigating claims the Islamic State jihadi who led the executions of 21 Egyptians was an American recruit.

The militant, who spoke English with a U.S. accent, appeared in a horrific video on Sunday showing the beheadings of a group of Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya.

Brandishing a knife, he declares: 'All crusaders... the sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah we will mix it with your blood.'

The men are then forced to lie face-down before they are beheaded simultaneously.

U.S. officials are understood to be analysing the militant's facial features and speech patterns as has been done in the hunt for the British executioner known as Jihadi John, who has appeared in a number of beheading videos in Syria.

Professor Erik Thomas, a linguistics expert at North Carolina State University, believes he 'sounds like an American' with some Arabic influence, based on some of word pronunciations.

One tactic is smuggling families and individuals into other countries. The report highlights one instance when a family paid ISIS over $8,000 per individual to sneak them into Turkey.

Drug smuggling is another. Al Monitor's report claims that IS traffics Afghan heroin into Europe from the city of Nineveh, which the Russian Federal Drug Control Service (RFDCS) says is generating 'significant revenues.'

Its drug business has become so successful in recent months that the RFDCS claims that IS now supplies half of Europe's entire heroin market.

Yesterday it was revealed that militants fighting for ISIS in Syria are making millions of pounds selling ancient statues and mosaics to wealthy Westerners using a complex system of smugglers and middle men.

Looted from ancient buildings in ISIS strongholds, such as the group's de facto capital city Raqqa, the antiquities are up to 10,000-years-old and can exchange hands for more than $1 million each.

The most expensive items are covertly smuggled overseas - usually on the orders of wealthy Europeans - but there is also a lucrative trade in less historically important objects, which often find their way into tourist shops and markets in neighbouring Lebanon and Turkey.

The trade in antiquities is one of ISIS' primary sources of funding, along with oil and ransom payments, and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year.

The finer points of ISIS trade in antiquities was uncovered in an investigation by the BBC.

It revealed that ISIS militants charge smugglers 20 per cent on the sale of ancient items found or looted in territory under its control. If the smugglers decide not to buy the items, they are promptly smashed to pieces as examples of idolatry, regardless of their historic significance."
754,"A statement attributed to the Islamic State group claimed that an American female hostage was killed in a Jordanian airstrike on Friday on the outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, the extremist group’s main stronghold.

Jordan launches new airstrikes after vowing harsh war on ISIS

Dozens of Jordanian fighter jets bombed ISIS training centers and weapons storage sites Thursday, intensifying attacks after the militants burned to death a captured Jordanian pilot.

As part of the new campaign, Jordan is also attacking targets in Iraq, said Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. Up to now, Jordan had struck ISIS targets in Syria, but not Iraq, as part of a U.S.-led military coalition.
The statement identified the woman as Kayla Jean Mueller and said she was killed during Muslim prayers — which usually take place around midday on Fridays — in airstrikes that targeted “the same location for more than an hour.”

No Islamic State militants were killed in the airstrikes, the statement further claimed. It published photos allegedly of the bombed site, showing a severely damaged brown colored three-story building — but no images of Mueller.

American officials said they were looking into the report. Bernadette Meehan, the spokeswoman for President Barack Obama’s National Security Council, said the White House has “not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates” the claim.


“We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports,” she added.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters travelling with the president to Indiana Friday that the U.S. does co-ordinate with the Jordanian air force as they fly airstrikes. He wouldn’t say whether the U.S. was aware of the hostage’s location.

The Islamic State statement could not be independently verified. It appeared on a militant website commonly used by the Islamic State and was also distributed by Islamic State-affiliated Twitter users.

Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said Jordan was looking into the claim.

“But as a first reaction, we think it’s illogical and we are highly skeptical about it,” he said. “How could they identify a Jordanian warplane … in the sky? What was the American lady doing in a weapons warehouse?”

“It’s part of their criminal propaganda. They have lied that our pilot is alive and tried to negotiate, claiming he is alive while they had killed him weeks before,” al-Momani added.

Mueller, of Prescott, Arizona, had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees, according to a 2013 article in The Daily Courier, her hometown newspaper. The 26-year-old told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria.

“For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,” she said. “It’s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.”

According to the local paper, Mueller had been working with the humanitarian aid agency Support to Life, as well as a local NGO that helped female Syrian refugees develop skills.


A 2007 article about Mueller from the same local newspaper said she was a student at Northern Arizona University and was active in the Save Darfur Coalition.

On Sunday, Obama said the U.S. was “deploying all the assets that we can” to find Mueller.

“We are in very close contact with the family trying to keep them updated,” he said in an interview with NBC’s Today Show. “Obviously this is something that is heart-breaking for the family and we want to make sure we do anything we can to make sure that any American citizen is rescued from this situation.”

Mueller’s identity had not been disclosed until now out of fears for her safety.

If her death is confirmed, she would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the Islamic State militants. Three other Americans, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group.

The Jordanian military said that Jordanian jetfighters carried out “a series of attacks today and destroyed the targets and returned safely.” It did not elaborate or give a location for the airstrikes.

But activists who monitor the Syrian conflict from inside the country said U.S.-led coalition planes hit several targets on the edges and outskirts of Raqqa, in quick succession on Friday.

A collective known as “Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently” said the planes targeted multiple Islamic State positions and headquarters in the western and eastern countryside of Raqqa, sending columns of smoke into the sky. Explosions could be heard in the city. The collective said there were no recorded civilian casualties, and did not mention Islamic State casualties.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of Islamic State members were killed in coalition airstrikes that targeted a tanks-and-vehicles depot in the area of al-Madajen and at least six other Islamic State positions, including a training camp and a prison.

755,"Less than two weeks after Aaron Sorkin said that Christian Bale would play Steve Jobs in the screenwriter's forthcoming biopic about the late Apple co-founder, Bale has dropped from the project. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Bale ""came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw"" before negotiations began. Sony, the studio releasing the film, had no comment on the THR report when contacted by HuffPost Entertainment.

Bale becomes the second high-profile star to bail on Sorkin's film within the last month. Back in October, Leonardo DiCaprio, who had been in talks to play Jobs, pulled himself out of consideration as well.

""We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that’s Chris Bale,"" Sorkin said to Bloomberg Television in a recent interview when asked about the Jobs role. ""He really is a phenomenal actor.""

It's unclear who will replace Bale as the lead of the film, but other actors once rumored included Bradley Cooper, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Last week, it was also reported that Seth Rogen was in talks to play Steve Wozniak, but that casting has not been confirmed at this time.

Danny Boyle, meanwhile, is still set to direct the film. He replaced David Fincher, who was initially attached to the project. When Fincher departed back in April, THR noted that he had wanted Bale to play the lead role as well.

773,"U.S. officials suspect that one of the five Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has attempted to return to terrorism, CNN reported Thursday.

The former prisoner, being held in Qatar, is believed to have tried to make contact with Taliban associates in Afghanistan, officials told CNN.

NBC News reported that it’s unknown whether the man actually connected with the Taliban or if it was a true effort to actually rejoin militants. The name of the former detainee has not been disclosed.

From CNN:

[A]n ongoing U.S. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in Qatar turned up evidence in recent months that one of them has “reached out” to try to encourage militant activity, one official said. The official would offer no further details.

Under current law, this act placed the man in the category of being “suspected” of re-engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. However, several officials say there is now a debate inside the administration that the intelligence may be stronger than the “suspected” classification. Some elements of the intelligence community believe the information is strong enough to classify the man as “confirmed” for returning to illegal activities. All five men are having their communications even more closely monitored right now, but the belief is there is no current threat, one official told CNN.

“We’re closely monitoring the situation and see no potential threat,” an official told NBC.

The prisoner swap, which occurred in May, drew ire from lawmakers who said the Obama administration broke federal law by not first informing Congress.

Bergdahl was back in the news this week with reports that the Army was preparing to charge him with desertion after he disappeared from his Afghanistan post in 2009 and was held in captivity for five years. The Army denied that any decision on charges had been made."
792,"Once thought to be a key component of Apple's acquisition of Beats, the Beats Music subscription service and accompanying brand will apparently be shuttered, leaving just iTunes-related software services, according to a new report.

Citing five sources at Apple and Beats, TechCrunch reported on Monday that although the exact timetable is unknown, Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music service and brand. People involved in the product are said to have already been moved onto other projects at the company, including iTunes.

If true, the move would be a change from May, when Apple emphasized Beats Music as a key component of its $3 billion purchase of the headphone maker. The Beats Music product received top billing over Beats Electronics in Apple's press release announcing the deal, even though the headphone making side of the business is the brand's most recognizable role.

Observers also believed that the Beats Music service allowed Apple to enter a key subscription market where the iTunes Store and iTunes Radio do not compete. Sales of digital albums have been declining in recent years as customers have migrated to competing services like Spotify and Pandora.

But Beats Music also got off to a slow start, with just 110,000 subscribers as of March. Its performance since being acquired by Apple remains unknown.

The rumor would suggest that Apple's $3 billion buyout of Beats was really about the headphones side of the business, as well as the talent and credibility brought on by the ""acqui-hires"" of Beats's Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.

Iovine is a longtime music industry executive and was a personal friend of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Both he and Dr. Dre have considerable sway in the industry and could help secure content for Apple's iTunes business.

When it was announced earlier this year, Apple's $3 billion buyout of Beats proved controversial, with critics suggesting that the iPhone maker had overpaid for a company better known for its brand than quality products. But proponents believe the addition of Beats products to Apple's portfolio will help the company earn revenue from a lucrative accessories market where the company did not previously compete.

Update: In a statement to Re/code, Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said the TechCrunch rumor is ""not true,"" but did not offer further comment on the matter. The publication cites sources at Apple as saying branding for Beats Music could change in the future, though the streaming service itself will remain active."
808,"A Catholic priest from Massachusetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father O’neal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isn’t a female."
841,"Korean outlet The Kyunghyang Shinmum reports a robot vacuum cleaner has attempted to eat a local woman, starting with her hair.

The woman appears to have been lying down on the floor of her home, having forgotten that her robot vacuum cleaner was set to patrol the area. Once the vacuum woke up, it sucked 5cm of her head hair into its innards.

The local fire department showed up with their hair-disentangling kit, dismantled the vacuum and rescued the woman who is reported to have emerged in the peak of health after the incident.

There's no indication the vacuum was doing anything other than obeying its programming, so let's not see this as the start of a robot uprising. Instead, the moral to this story appears simple and sounds nicely Old Testament: do not lay down with thine robot vacuum cleaner. And revise thine object detection and avoidance algorithms lest the next such incident spark a lawsuit. ®"
846,"Several Iraqi news sources, including Al Sabah and the website al-Maalomah, reported on Wednesday that several ISIS fighters sought help at a hospital in Mosul, 250 miles north of the city of Baghdad, after developing symptoms of Ebola virus infection.
Citing anonymous sources in a hospital in Mosul, Al-Sabah reported that two cases of Ebola and 26 cases of HIV/AIDS were confirmed by health authorities in Mosul. The newspaper also claimed that ISIS recruits from some African countries brought the virus to Iraq.
The International Business Times UK also carried a similar report, quoting Iraqi news sources.
But a spokesperson for the Iraqi health ministry, Ahmed Rudaini, has denied reports that two cases of Ebola virus infection were diagnosed among ISIS militants in Mosul. The Iraqi health ministry spokesperson said the infection couldn't have been confirmed in Mosul because none of the hospitals in the city have the diagnostic facilities. He said only the Central Laboratory of Public Health in Baghdad has the ability to confirm cases of Ebola virus infection.
Responding to inquiries from Mashable, a WHO spokesperson, Christy Feigh, said, ""We have no official notification that it is Ebola.""
Feigh said the WHO was investigating the reports and would give assistance if needed. But because UN workers are banned from entering ISIS-held areas in Iraq and Syria, it is unclear how the organization would be able to confirm the report or render assistance in suspected cases.
Mashable, however, reports that a Kurdish official who appeared convinced that the reports were accurate told the Kurdish news outlet Xendan that the militants reported at the hospital in Mosul with symptoms of Ebola virus infection.
While Iraqi health officials are probably not taking the reports seriously, an outbreak of Ebola among ISIS militants could have serious consequences due to lack of access to the ISIS-held areas. It is also feared that ISIS militants could use the presence of the virus among its militants as a terror weapon against opponents, further complicating the prosecution of the war against the extremist group.
However, the symptoms of Ebola virus, including vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding in the late stages of the disease are similar to those of several other diseases, including malaria, yellow fever and typhoid fever. Thus, it is possible that the militants who reported at the hospital in Mosul were suffering from other diseases that have symptoms similar to Ebola.
Given the fact that the reports were carried exclusively on pro-government newspapers, it is not possible to rule out that they were designed to cause confusion among ISIS fighters and discourage new recruits from joining the group. It is not known that ISIS has a significant number of recruits from West African countries where the epidemic has been reported. Thousands of foreign recruits to ISIS arrived mostly from North African countries such as Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Algeria and Somalia where there have been no reports of Ebola outbreak.
The Ebola virus epidemic has claimed thousands of lives in the West African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.
Recently, Nigerian news sources reported that ISIS was making efforts to recruit fighters from the country. The report led the Nigerian government to issue a statement urging some Middle Eastern countries to carry out thorough background checks on Nigerians applying for visas.
The report that some ISIS militants might have contracted Ebola comes a few weeks after Benjamin T. Decker, intelligence analyst and Iraq specialist with the Middle East research firm Levantine Group, said that ISIS executed about 11 doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded militants.
Mosul was among several cities ISIS fighters captured earlier in the year 2014. The militants declared an Islamic caliphate in the areas they captured. Mosul, in particular, has been under ISIS control since June 2014. The city has reportedly suffered food, water and power shortages since extremist militants took over. Residents have suffered brutal treatment with reports of executions and enslavement of minorities women and children.
On Wednesday, the US and its allies carried out 17 airstrikes in Syria and 12 in Iraq. The airstrikes in Syria targeted ISIS facilities in Al Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr and Kobani, while the strikes in Iraq hit ISIS buildings and positions around Mosul, Fallujah and Sinja."
849,"TALLAHASSEE — A lawyer and Florida State University alum was identified by police Thursday as the gunman whose rampage left three people wounded and sent hundreds of panicked students scrambling for exits and ducking for cover.

Officers responding to 911 calls early Thursday fatally shot Myron May, a 2005 FSU grad who had moved back into the area in recent weeks,Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said.

""He refused to surrender and as a result he was shot and killed by officers,"" DeLeo said. DeLeo did not say whether May fired at police, a contention cited by a department spokesman earlier in the day.

DeLeo said May and written documents and made videos that discuss ""being targeted."" May's Facebook page includes Bible verses and links to conspiracy theories about the government reading people's minds.

""Mr. May was in a state of crisis... struggling either psychologically or emotionally,"" DeLeo said.

One victim was hospitalized in critical condition and another in good condition, a spokesperson for Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare said. A third person was grazed by a bullet and was treated at the scene and released.

Campus Police Chief David Perry said classes will resume Friday and the library will reopen. He promised a strong police presence. Officials canceled classes Thursday but kept the campus open and made counseling available to students and staff.

""We will get through this as a community, we will get through this as a university,"" Perry said.

More than 300 students were in Strozier Library when the shooting began at about 12:15 a.m. DeLeo said May, firing a semiautomatic .380 caliber weapon, never got past the library lobby.

Jason Derfuss, 21, said he was leaving the library when the shooter opened fire near him. Derfuss posted on Facebook pictures of a bullet and a book, Great Medieval Thinkers: John Wyclif, the bulllet had torn through. Derfuss says in his post he was near the gunman when the shooting started but never felt the shot and only discovered the damage three hours later.

""He was about 5 feet from me, but he hit my books,"" Derfuss said. ""I assumed I wasn't a target, I assumed I was fine. The truth is I was almost killed tonight and God intervened.""

""You never think something like this is going to happen to you until you have to react in that situation when someone is screaming there is a gun in the building. I ran for my life,"" said Allison Kope, a freshman from Cocoa Beach, Fla. ""I ran right out the back door. My laptop and everything is still in there. It was shock. It was just instinct. You don't think about anything else, you just go.""

The shooting started shortly around 12:30 a.m. ET. About 300 to 400 students were inside the campus' main library, which is open 24 hours on weekdays, when the shooter entered with a handgun and opened fire.

University President John Thrasher described the shootings as an isolated incident but also said police did ""an extraordinary job taking quick and decisive action to prevent further tragedy.""

Daniel Morales, a 19-year-old freshman from Fort Pierce, Fla., said that when he first heard someone say, "" 'Somebody's got a gun.' I thought he was joking."" But after realizing a gunman was in the library, Morales and others raced to a back room on the second floor where they barricaded a door with desks.

Three freshmen who were in the DeGraff Hall dormitory at the time said they began getting reports from friends locked down in the library.

""We know there are definitely people who saw the shooter,"" Anthony Coons said.

His friend Max Martin described the surreal scene.

""You hear all these stories on the news, then it happens,"" Martin said. ""This is something you never want to happen.""

Nikolai Hernandez, who was in another dorm room nearby, said he heard ""consecutive gunshots"" that sounded as if they came from an automatic rifle.

""That was confirmed when I went outside and talked to someone who said they saw police open fire on a shooter who was armed right on the front steps of the library,"" the freshman said.

The video below was posted on Facebook by Jessica Davis. An individual can be heard over the intercom saying ""There has been a shooting in the library. Stay where you are,"" and instructing people to call 911 if they have been shot.

Students were allowed to leave the library about 3 a.m. Before that, students were on lockdown at the campus' library and in dorms.

The shooting is being investigated as a homicide and attempted murder case, said Chief Michael DeLeo of the Tallahassee Police Department.

Florida State University police issued an alert warning its 40,000 students that read: ""Dangerous Situation! Main Campus — Tallahassee. Seek shelter immediately, away from doors and windows.""

""If there is any positive news we can take from this occurrence (it) is that the victim count was not higher,"" Tallahassee Mayor-elect Andrew Gillum said.

Social media immediately lit up with messages of concern and prayer requests.

858,"Is Fidel Castro dead? Yes, a man named “Fidel Castro” has died, but he’s not the famous Castro you might be thinking of. The prospect that the leader of Cuba might have died is circulating on the internet, and the rumors claim Fidel Castro’s death was supposed be announced at an official conference, according to the Castro health rumors, but already Cuba has denied these rumors.

In a related report by the Inquisitr, it’s claimed that Ian Fleming, the author of the famous James Bond series, helped former President Kennedy to hatch a Fidel Castro assassination plot.

According to the el Nuevo Herald, the rumors claimed Fidel Castro dead because a man named Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of an important politician in Kenya, died over the weekend at the age of 14 years old.

“Castro Odinga was the son of Raila Odinga, the main opposition leader in Kenya and was considered a possible successor to his father. It is possible that his death and his name have confused many users of Twitter, and these have begun to spread the word about the supposed death of the Cuban leader.”

Kenyan police are currently investigating Odinga’s death, and these headlines may have encouraged rumors about the Cuban leader.

According to Laiguana TV, it’s also possible that a blog by Yusnaby Perez may have sparked rumors that claimed Fidel Castro dead because he had not been in public in many months.

“How strange! It is the first year since I can remember the anniversary of the Revolution that Fidel does not appear.”

Thursday marked a year since the former Cuban president made a public appearance. Castro has apparently received foreign dignitaries at his home in Havana, but has not commented publicly on the recent changes between Cuba and the United States that was announced on December 17, 2014.

The rumors were increased even further when Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on Fidel Castro’s death. The newspaper quickly retracted its report, but not before the alleged “news” about Castro went viral.

Because of these rumors several media outlets in Venezuela and Cuba claimed the Cuban government planned on calling a press conference to discuss Fidel Castro’s heath condition. But an official from the International Press Centre (CPI), the department Cuban Foreign Ministry serving foreign media, says this rumor is false, saying,

“That is false. No press conference was convened, no.”

In addition, Castro’s influential nephew, Alejandro Castro Espin, who is currently in Greece, told a radio station his uncle is “in good health” and there’s no reason to speculate about Castro’s death."
878,"STOCKHOLM — Speaking via Google Hangout to officials in Sweden last week, former NSA Contractor Edward Snowden dropped a bag of coal on his former employers by revealing the hugely popular “Elf on a Shelf” trend is actually an intelligence gathering operation originating with and run by the National Security Agency.

“It actually started out as a joke,” Snowden said in his speech. “Someone photocopied a picture of an elf with the caption ‘I’m watching you,’ and it just kept moving from cubicle to cubicle.”

Snowden said that at some point it occurred to someone that if people as paranoid as NSA staff would play this game, what would happen with civilians?

“Now, the NSA has an agent inside practically every home with a child in it,” Snowden said.

“The elves have basic mobility, which isn’t a problem because when one shows up someplace unexpected,” Snowden added, “it’s just assumed to be part of the game.”

Through these adorable snoops, the NSA has gained access to millions of tax returns, bank statements, and 10-year old boys unwrapping and re-wrapping their presents in the days ahead of Christmas.

“We would flag those kids for later recruitment to the intelligence community,” Snowden said. “Especially for Tailored Access Operations.”

In addition, the NSA has uncovered a trove of data about the personal lives of millions of Americans, sources confirmed.

“The NSA has incorporated advanced sensors into these things that can uncover all kinds of information,” journalist Glenn Greenwald told Duffel Blog in an email.  “They can tell things about people’s health — cancer, heart disease, liver disease. They know who’s being naughty, and who’s being really naughty, things that even extensive online snooping couldn’t provide. Dildos, vibrators, chains — all the things stashed in closets and under beds.”

Sources told reporters these were previously inaccessible to the government’s leading intelligence agency, if the owners paid cash at least.

“If you want to know why the ‘privacy advocates’ have settled down, and moved on? My guess is, blackmail. These elves have accumulated petabytes of evidence against pretty much everybody,” Snowden said.

“You wouldn’t believe what perverse things people will do to each other, right in front of these things,” Snowden concluded. “It’s why ‘ElfMonitor’ is such a highly sought after duty assignment.”"
897,"So here's the latest in wild internet rumors.

Everyone thinks that the President of Argentina Christina Fernández de Kirchner adopted a young Jewish man in order to stop him from turning into a werewolf. The story was reported by The Independent and others.

Well, the story's kind of true — Fernández de Kirchner did adopt the young man as her godson — but not to keep him from turning into a werewolf.

There's an old Argentinian legend that a seventh child will turn into ""el lobizon"" — aka a werewolf — after his 13th birthday, and then terrorize the Argentinian countryside at night whenever there's a full moon, as reported by the Independent. In the 19th century, parents were reportedly so spooked by ""el lobizon"" that they started abandoning and murdering their 7th children.

Around the same time, in the early 20th century, another tradition involving a seventh child came to be. Argentinian presidents started adopting the seventh child born in a family as godchildren.

Mágico fue recibir a Iair Tawil, 1er ahijado presidencial de nuestra historia que profesa la fe judía. pic.twitter.com/18eNPR5kXv

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

Over the last few days, sources have been reporting that this Argentinian custom was adopted as a response to the murder and abandonment of these ""el lobizon"" children.

However, others like the Guardian are debunking this. Reportedly, the godchild custom goes back all the way to 1907 when Russian emigrés asked the then-president José Figueroa Alcorta to become the godfather to their seventh son, reports the Guardian.

""The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,"" Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told The Guardian.

So what exactly what special about Iair Tawil's case? Traditionally, the seventh son or daughter could only become a godchild of the Argentinian president if he or she was Christian. But Tawil was the first Jewish young man to do so — making it a tweet-worthy affair.

Fernández has become the president godmother to roughly 700 children since she took office in 2007, reports The Guardian.

No word on how many children she has saved from becoming werewolves."
902,"A Jordanian government spokesman has denied rumours that the Jordanian King Abdullah II, a trained pilot, is personally conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State (Isis).

Mohammed al-Momani said in a statement that reports about the personal involvement of the King in combat missions on IS targets is unfounded and baseless.

Rumours on King Abdullah spread after the he promised to fight back hard against IS, saying that the death of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh ""will not be in vain"".

""We are waging this war to protect our faith, our values and human principles and our war for their sake will be relentless and will hit them in their own ground,"" he said on state television.

Momani had revealed earlier that Jordan will intensify its efforts with an US-led coalition against IS.

Later on Wednesday, Abdullah vowed ""relentless"" war against IS, saying Jordan will ""hit them on their own ground"".

Iraqi news outlets cited unofficial sources saying that the king was personally flying a plane. Jordanian author Waleed Abu Anada tweeted:

BREAKING: Local reports here in Jordan say that King Abdullah will personally fly and lead the airstrikes against ISIS tomorrow. #IAmMoath— Waleed Abu Nada (@waleedabunada) February 4, 2015

Before becoming king, Abdullah II was a general in charge of Jordanian special forces and a certified Cobra Helicopter pilot. In 1980 he joined the UK's Royal military academy Sandhurst.

After the barbaric video of Kasasbeh burning to death emerged, The Royal Hashemite Court's Facebook page published a picture of the King in pilot gear:

The picture was retweeted several times and used by some as a proof that the Jordanian king was gearing up to fight IS in person.

909,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. —Research Medical Center said a patient who came to its Brookside Campus emergency department for treatment does not have the symptom profile of Ebola.

The hospital issued the statement to stop rumors and online reports that the patient was being treated for the disease.

""These reports are inaccurate,"" said HCA Midwest Health spokeswoman Chris Hamele.

She said the patient was taken to the hospital's main campus, where he being treated appropriately for his illness and is responding well in good condition. The man had one of the symptoms of Ebola and had recently traveled to Nigeria.

The symptoms of the disease can include a high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding and bruising.

Local health officials have said it's extremely unlikely that the patient has Ebola.

Family members with patients in the emergency room at Research Medical Center said it was business as usual there on Sunday.

""If it's something we should have been concerned about, I think they would have said something,"" said patient Collette Harvin.

Marcus Mitchem, who was visiting a patient, said Ebola is a scary thing to think about.

""The most concerning thing about the Ebola virus is no known cure. You get it, you die. That causes concern for everybody,"" he said.

Several Americans who contracted Ebola while in Africa have returned to the United States and responded well to treatment, in part due to safety protocols at American hospitals.

Hamele said Research Medical Center has standard infectious disease precautions, and is well-equipped and well prepared to implement them.

""As health care providers, our job is to care for sick patients and we will continue to provide high quality care to our community as we always have,"" Hamele said.

Harvin said she's not really afraid about Ebola.

""We have measures here. We have medicine,"" she said. ""If we were in Africa or something like that, I'd be a little more worried.""

The Kansas City Health Department said in a tweet that local hospitals have procedures to protect patients, staff and visitors from infectious diseases. It said it has complete faith that Research Medical Center is taking the appropriate steps.

""It's important to remember,"" the Health Department tweeted. ""You cannot get Ebola unless you handle bodily fluids of someone who has Ebola.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reminds the public that it's not spread through casual contact or the air.

More than 3,000 people have died from the outbreak. About 2,000 U.S. troops are already helping Ebola-affected countries. On Friday, the Pentagon announced that number could grow to 4,000."
918,"Mittens the cat has both male and female genitalia.

The Canadian kitty, who lives with its owner in Heart's Desire, Newfoundland, will need surgery to cure its bowel and urinary problems as a result of its dual gender, CBC reports.

Colleen Clarke-Murphy took Mittens in when her daughter brought it home, thinking it was a stray. In October, Mittens was rushed to a vet, who gave the surprising news. Clarke-Murphy said her first response was, ""Did I just hear you right?""

Since gender assignment surgery is more a medical need than a cosmetic one, the initial question was, which gender should Mittens be?

Clarke-Murphy said she'd rather have a female cat, but she'll follow the veterinarian's recommendation to make Mittens a male.

""They're the ones who know what they're doing. I mean, I really don't know. I'd like for it to be a female, but it really don't matter. It's got both parts,"" she said. ""I think it's got both personalities, so it really don't matter.""

Mittens will need to be both spayed and neutered before the $1,500 reconstructive surgery. Good luck, Mittens!

Cats with two genders may be uncommon, but they're not unheard of, Liverpool Echo reports. Late last year, a couple in Liverpool was shocked to find that their little white princess, Twinkle, was also a little white prince.

Twinkle's vet recommended that the male parts be removed, and made it so. The feline is reportedly doing well -- alongside her brother Socks -- after her gender assignment surgery.

923,"President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchhner adopted Yair Tawil as her godson, due to an Argentine folktale that says the seventh born son in a family will turn into a werewolf, and eat unbaptized babies.

Argentina's president has adopted a young Jewish boy as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.

Yair Tawil was adopted in a ceremony which took place because of Argentinian folklore, reports the Independent.

He is the first Jewish boy to be adopted, as the practice only applied to Catholics until 2009.

According to tradition in the country, the seventh son born to a family turns into a werewolf, a feared ""el lobison"".

The creature only shows its true nature on the first Friday after the boy's 13th birthday, turning the teenager into a demon at midnight during every full moon.

Legend has it that the lobison feeds on unbaptized babies.

Although the story may now seem fanciful, fear of the werewolf-like creature was so widespread in 19th century Argentina that some families even murdered their babies.

To stop the practice happening the Argentine president began adopting babies.

Any family now which has seven sons or daughters get the president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship, reports the Independent.

President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchhner described the adoption as a ""magical moment"" and called the Tawils a ""marvelous family""."
924,"What’s wrong with building a snowman? Plenty if you ask a scholar of Islam in Saudi Arabia. A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric apparently issued a religious ruling, officially called as a ‘Fatwa’, forbidding the building of snowmen. According to the cleric the practice is highly anti-Islamic.

The religious scholar, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid strongly believes that building snowmen isn’t an acceptable Islamic practice and it should cease with immediate effect. The leader confirmed his viewpoint on a website where one of the members had asked whether it was OK for fathers to build snowmen for their children. To this, the cleric replied in the negative, saying,

“It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.”

Sheikh Munajjid had an explanation ready to back his fatwa. He argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being. Under the Saudi kingdom’s strict interpretation of Sunni Islam, such an action is considered a sin. While noting his ruling, he added,

“God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,”

In simpler terms, the cleric was OK with building snow figurines representing anything non-human or animals for that matter. As amusing as it might sound, children might now be left with other “inanimate” objects only. How does one have fun building a snow sculpture of a tree, isn’t what the religious leader pondered much upon.

Fortunately for the children, the fatwa hasn’t been accorded a date of implementation and moreover, no local government authority has officially confirmed or denied the same. Apparently, any cleric in Saudi Arabia is entitled to issue a fatwa. However, they are to strictly base their rulings on the teachings of Islam and must have valid basis under Saudi law.

The country’s northern regions have been recently lashed by multiple snowstorms leaving in their wake sporadic accumulations of snow that will soon melt away. Despite being the second hottest country in the world snow has covered a few upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia’s border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East.

Though this is a rare opportunity for children to enjoy the snow, perhaps the cleric has put a severe dampener on their plans to build a big snowman.

933,"Islamic State militants released a video on Tuesday purporting to show the beheading of American journalist James Wright Foley, who has been missing since he was kidnapped in northwest Syria on November 22, 2012. Foley was abducted by unknown gunmen outside a cafe in Binesh, along with his translator, who was later released.

Another captive is shown at the end of the video. He is identified as Steven Sotloff, an American journalist who has been missing since August 2013.

The video has not yet been independently verified. The video and images were released on Twitter by user @mujahid4life. The account has since been suspended.

A freelancer known for his work covering conflict in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya, Foley had contributed work to GlobalPost, Agence France-Presse, and various other outlets. In 2011, he was kidnapped and held by pro-Qaddafi forces in Libya before being released after 45 days.

""Captivity is the state most violently opposite his nature,"" his friend Clare Morgana Gillis, a journalist who had been kidnapped with him in Libya in 2011, wrote in a piece last year for Syria Deeply. ""But when we were detained in Tripoli, Jim automatically turned his energies to keeping up our strength and hope.""

In the video, the man identified as Foley delivers what appears to be a prepared statement.

""I call on my friends, family, and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government,"" he says. ""For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality.""

He goes on to decry the American aerial operation in Iraq, and ends by saying, ""I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again. But that ship has sailed. I guess all in all I wish I wasn't American.""

A masked militant attired in black stands beside him. 

""This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country,"" the militant says, brandishing a knife in his left hand. ""As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State. You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs. Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide. So effectively any aggression towards the Islamic State is an aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic caliphate as their leadership. So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

The video then shows the militant begin to cut the man's throat with the knife before fading to black, followed by a graphic image of his body.

The militant then appears standing beside the man identified as Sotloff.

""The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,"" he says."
936,"Islamic State (Isis) militants in Mosul may have contracted Ebola, according to Iraqi media reports of suspected cases at an IS-controlled hospital in the city.

The government and Kurdish media reported that militants were displaying symptoms similar to those of Ebola. The World Health Organization has not been able to confirm this but has offered assistance to Iraqi officials.

Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said Ebola arrived in Mosul from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries and Africa"", reports Mashable.

However, it is uncertain if any IS recruits came from the Ebola-hit regions of West Africa. Most have come from Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Somalia.

A number of other illnesses could be to blame for the fighters' symptoms. Malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever and the Marburg virus could all be confused with Ebola as they can also cause fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.

IS, a group that has been known to dismiss some aspects of science and modern medicine, recently executed a number of Iraqi doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat militants. UN workers have also been prohibited from entering their territory, an intelligence analyst who specialises in Iraq told Mashable.

938,"A group of ISIS militants in Iraq have allegedly gone to a local hospital to be treated for what is believed to be Ebola.

Three local media outlets reported this week that a number of ISIS fighters have shown signs of the deadly disease and were taken to a hospital in Mosul to be treated. The reports are currently unconfirmed, but the World Health Organization says that they are investigating the claims and that they are attempting to reach out to officials in the area to offer help.

“We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,” WHO’s director of communications Christy Feig told Mashable in a statement.

Feig reportedly went on to acknowledge that, despite their best efforts to offer help to area officials, if Ebola has in fact reached them, having an impact in an ISIS-controlled area could prove to be challenging.

Ebola reached epidemic levels last year in parts of Africa, and fear that the virus would spread in the United States took over the headlines for weeks this past fall. However, so far, the disease has yet to make any serious impact in the states.

Iraq’s pro-government newspaper al Sabaah claims that the disease has spread to Mosul through “terrorists” coming from “several countries” in Africa.

Symptoms of Ebola include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bruising, and severe bleeding, but any of those ailments could be attributed to a number of other conditions, so it’s not entirely clear if the reported Ebola diagnoses are accurate.

966,"A meteorite landed ""like a bomb"" just missing Nicaragua's main airport and raising concerns over scientists' ability to track space objects on potential collision courses with Earth.

Officials said they ""thanked God"" there were no injuries as the rock landed in Managua, a sprawling city of 1.2 million people where it left a crater 12 metres (40ft) wide and five metres (16ft) deep.

The object was believed to have been a small part of the asteroid 2014 RC, nicknamed ""Pitbull,"" which astronomers had been monitoring as it passed the planet.

Nasa currently tracks more than 11,000 asteroids that come relatively close to Earth but 2014 RC, which is the size of a large house, was only discovered on Aug 31.

It moved within 25,000 miles of the Earth's surface and had been projected to be at its nearest point over New Zealand on Sunday.

The meteorite that apparently originated from 2014 RC landed in a wooded area just before midnight on Saturday.

Its impact registered on instruments used to detect earthquakes, which regularly hit Nicaragua.

People living nearby head an an explosion and described seeing liquid, sand and dust blowing thought the air, and the smell of burning.

Jorge Santamaria, who lives near the airport, said: ""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave.""

Jose Millan, of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies, said: ""We need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population.

""All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event.""

Nicaragua said it would be asking for assistance from international scientists, including those from the United States, to investigate.

The composition of the meteorite has yet to be determined and it was not clear if it had disintegrated on hitting the ground or been buried under the ground.

Wilfredo Strauss of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies, said: ""We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact.

""You can see two waves on the seismic equipment). First, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit Earth, and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound.""

Rosario Murillo, Nicaragua's First Lady and Government spokeswoman, said the object ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""

In February 2013 a meteor that had not previously been detected by scientists exploded over Chelyabinsk in Central Russia, injuring more than 1,000 people.

Dr Dan Brown, an astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: ""The possible meteorite impact in Nicaragua, linked with the asteroid 2014 RC which flew by Earth raises some interesting questions.

""Although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed Earth, that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it.

""If it was an unrelated object, however, then it further demonstrates how we don't really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there."""
971,"Some 219 years ago, founding fathers Sam Adams and Paul Revere looked on as a bit of history was tucked into a corner stone of the Massachusetts State House. On Thursday, excavators carefully extracted the keepsakes, according to the Boston Globe.

The time capsule, contained in a 5-by-7-inch copper box, is thought to hold a collection of coins and other artifacts dating as far back as 1652. The capsule had actually already been extracted in 1855, when the original cowhide capsule was replaced with the metal box and new items, including coins from the 1800s, were added to the stash.The box had then been mortared inside the State House cornerstone.

Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance, told the Globe the box may also hold an engraved silver plate, newspapers, the seal of the Commonwealth, cards and the title page of the Massachusetts Colony Records.

Time Capsule Has Steve Jobs' Computer Mouse

It’s believed to be one of the oldest time capsules ever recovered in the state — and likely would have remained in place had it not been for concerns that water had been seeping into the State House at that particular corner. That inspection prompted officials to re-excavate the time capsule to investigate its contents and make sure the items are in good condition.

“Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building, but of our Commonwealth and our country,” said Secretary of State William Galvin, who was on hand for the capsule’s excavation, according to the Boston Globe.

As luck would have it, another time capsule was recovered in Boston just this past October. That 100-year-old capsule was extracted from its holding in the head of a golden lion statue that had perched atop the Old State House in downtown Boston. That capsule held sealed letters, photographs, and newspaper articles.

As for this most recently extracted time capsule, it’s now being held in a safe at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. On Sunday examiners will X-ray the box and they plan to carefully open it and inspect its contents next week. After that, it will be returned to the State House cornerstone, perhaps with a few new items added for future generations to rediscover.

989,"Industry sources indicate Apple is planning to lean heavily on Samsung as a component supplier for both new iPhone 6 builds and the upcoming Apple Watch, reports BusinessKorea (via G for Games). If true, this would be a marked change from Apple's reported goal of lessening its reliance on Samsung by seeking alternative suppliers for critical hardware components.

According to the report, Apple is looking to Samsung to supply RAM, NAND flash storage, and batteries for future iPhone 6 production, supplementing or replacing current suppliers for those components.

NAND flash has been a particular area of concern for Apple according to recent news reports, with the company's decision to use cheaper and slower TLC (triple-level cell) flash memory for larger-capacity iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models being blamed for sporadic crashing issues. Apple has reportedly moved to stop the use of its current TLC NAND flash chips and supposedly is back at the negotiating table with the South Korean supplier.At first, Apple discussed with Samsung about the supply of NAND flash for the iPhone 6. Due to problems with prices, Toshiba's TLC NAND flash was used in the 128GB models, and components made by SK Hynix, Toshiba, and SanDisk were used in the 64GB models.

However, as overseas IT news sites reported functional defects in the 128GB models, Apple is said to be considering whether or not to replace the TLC NAND flash made by Toshiba with Samsung's own TLC NAND flash. If Apple and Samsung strike a deal, Samsung will supply both DRAM and NAND flash to the iPhone 6.Beyond the iPhone 6, the same Korean industry sources also claim Samsung will supply Apple with application processors for the Apple Watch, which is slated to debut in early 2015.

Apple touts the Apple Watch as using a new ""S1"" module for the internals that seals nearly all of the internal components into a single resin-filled package for durability. The individual components of the S1 are undoubtedly being provided by several different manufacturers, but according to today's report the main application processor portion will be coming from Samsung.

994,"A new TV show in Peru has captured the moment unwitting men have been caught wolf-whistling their own mothers.

The experiment took two mothers, whose sons were identified as repeat cat-callers, and disguised them using make-up, wigs and clothes. The women then women walked past their sons to gauge their reaction.

The mother wearing a disguise of a wig and sunglasses walks past her unsuspecting son and a friend, before he makes a comment towards her

The mother then goes over to confront her child, who is still unaware the woman is actually his parent

The man acts in horror as he realises it is his own mother and she launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty

The mother gets so angry with her son, she then takes off her bag and proceeds to hit him with it due to this behaviour

In the first case, the mother is dressed in a short black dress and walks past her son and a friend in the street.

The son then unwittingly makes a comment at his mother saying 'tasty panties' which prompts her to go and confront him.

She then removes her sunglasses and the man then realises he has just cat-called his own mother.

The mother then launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty and saying she never taught him to talk to women in that manner.

Another mother, wearing a black wig walks past her son, who is standing working on the streets of Lima

After making a remark towards his mother, she then turns around and goes over to confront him

She then takes off her wig to reveal herself and then throws it on the floor in anger after being disgusted by her son's behaviour

The mother then tells her son he should be ashamed of himself for speaking to her like that, as he pleads with her to calm down

She then gets so angry with her child that she then removes her bag and hits him with it.

Meanwhile in the second case, the mother wearing a green dress, walks past her son, who calls her 'piggy'.

She then calls his name before taking off her wig and confronting her son, hitting him with her hairpiece.

The man then tries to claim he didn't make the remark but is then forced to apologise to his mother before she walks off

She too launches into a tirade telling her son to he should be ashamed of himself, while he pleads with his mother to quieten down as he is working.

He then tries to claim he didn't make the remark and it a man in a nearby car, but he eventually apologises before his mother walks off.

The video ends with a warning saying men should start respecting women before they unwittingly harass their own mothers.

It comes after the video claims that seven in 10 women say they have experienced sexual harassment on the streets of the Peruvian capital Lima."
1010,"Islamic State (ISIS) militants claim to have captured a supply bundle dropped by U.S. forces near the northern Syrian town of Kobani. Video posted to a YouTube channel associated with ISIS shows them rifling through packages containing dozens of grenades.

The supply package was apparently one of many intended for Kurdish fighters who have been battling ISIS militants for control of the strategically important town for weeks. The footage has not been independently verified.

According to Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby, the majority of supplies were safely delivered to Kurdish forces, which have been supported by a U.S.-led coalition as they defend the town. However, Kirby said that at least one supply package may have fallen into the hands of the Islamic State.

""We are aware that one bundle was destroyed [via a video],"" said Kirby. ""Analysts are working as fast as they can to validate it.""

U.S. forces airdropped a total of 27 bundles containing weapons, ammunition and medical supplies early Monday. The supplies were provided by Kurdish authorities.

Kobani, located just yards from the Turkish border, has been the scene of an intense battle between Kurdish forces and ISIS militants, who attacked the area in late September.

1020,"YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin decided to give a man named Thomas the money and follow him to see how he spends it. His first stop was a local liquor store but instead of buying alcohol he purchased food that he gave away to others in need.

A homeless man was given a chance, and he touched an awful lot of surprised people.

A viral online video from YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin tells the story of a homeless man named Thomas and his desire to not let his circumstances keep him from being selfless - by using his newfound money to help not himself, but others.

Josh made the video, which has received more than 11 million hits by Wednesday morning, with the idea to give a random homeless person $100 and secretly follow him to see how he spends it.

He meets an elderly man with gray hair, a mustache and dark jacket named Thomas holding up a sign along a highway. He tells Josh he's just trying to get enough to buy something to eat and Josh shocks him with the $100.

""Oh goodness. Oh no way,"" he says as Josh pulls five $20 bills from his wallet. ""Oh brother, are you sure? I'm starting to tear up over here. That's like incredible.""

Josh reassures him it's totally fine as they hug. Thomas says he never had something like this happen before in his life.

The next part of the video seemed to be expected by many viewers but Thomas surprised them all.

He packed up his stuff and began walking down the road to a liquor store. The video records him exit the store with several bags, but he didn't buy alcohol.

He purchased food that he then delivered to other needy people in a nearby park.

Josh appears to tell Thomas what was going on.

""I feel like I owe you an apology,"" Josh said as he reaches to grab Thomas' hand. ""You went to a liquor store earlier —""

""You thought I was going to get all smacked up drunk, huh?"" Thomas interrupts. ""But there's things money can't buy and I get a happiness out of what I'm doing.""

Ironically during Josh's confession a man sitting at a picnic table behind them takes a swig from a bottle wrapped in a plastic bag.

But Josh wanted to contribute to Thomas's good deeds. He reached into his wallet again and gave him another $100.

""You just touched my heart,"" he told his new friend.

Thomas was stunned again.

""I don't know what to say. Usually I'm pretty talkative,"" he replied.

Thomas explained that he recently quit his job and was caring for his ailing stepfather who ultimately died of cancer. His mom died two weeks later from kidney failure and suddenly their building was sold leaving Thomas without a place to live.

""There's a lot of people that are just victims of circumstance. There's a lot of good people that are homeless,"" he said. ""You're doing good … you'll bump into good people. That's all there is to it. You're on a different path somehow in life. I can't explain it.""

But Josh is trying to change his path.

He established a fund-raising campaign to help Thomas get a new home and a job.

The fund had a goal of $10,000 but it surpassed $55,000 through Wednesday morning.

""People think I changed his life,"" Josh told TODAY. ""For me, it's completely the opposite. I feel that he changed my life.""

1025,"Apple is reportedly limiting what Apple Watch apps are capable of doing, ruling out certain features in order to ensure battery life is not too heavily drained in the initial model, which could tarnish the high-profile launch.

According to Business Insider, developers working on applications for the new Apple wearable have cautioned that consumers should temper their expectations of what the initial Apple Watch is capable of.

The caution harkens back to the initial iPhone launch, when the App Store did not exist, and only the apps pre-loaded by Apple could be used. While the smartphone ecosystem has dramatically changed since then, and Apple’s App Store has proved a template for a new industry, the Apple Watch looks as though it may mirror this model until capabilities improve.

The primary issue is battery life, and Apple’s continued attempts to increase the time between recharges. Earlier reports suggested that the device would have only four hours of active battery life, and many of the sensor features initially touted to be included have been cut due to inconsistency.

Those sensors that do remain are the source of many of the battery issues, according to Sumit Mehra, CTO of Y Media Labs, an app studio which has been developing content for the Apple Watch.

“Sensors take up a lot of battery, and they don’t want every app out there on the Apple Watch using these sensors because all of a sudden this watch will only give you four hours of battery life, and then it’s not a watch anymore if I have to charge my wrist every four hours,” said Mehra in a statement to Business Insider.

Apple has not yet released its WatchKit SDK for developing standalone apps for the Apple Watch, with developers at the moment limited to creating extensions to iPhone apps that will function on the watch. This helps save battery for the wearable, and means apps can run on the iPhone’s superior processor, but also limits Apple Watch apps to notifications, app extensions and presenting summaries of information – essentially limited versions of what the iPhone can already do.

With the expected launch of the Apple Watch less than a week away, and Apple predicting huge numbers of sales for its first ever wearable, consumers might be wise to rethink what the device is going to be capable of, at least for the time being."

Mojang has historically been proud of its independence, shying away from acquisition offers and from entering the public market. Mojang co-founder and Minecraft mastermind Markus ""Notch"" Persson turned down a job in 2010 at the most desirable gaming company in America, Valve, in order to continue work on Minecraft.

Last year, Mojang co-founder Carl Manneh said to Reuters, ""We've always felt that the independence we have is one of our core strengths. We can take decisions by going into a room and in 15 minutes we're done. We try to be extremely agile, to release games quickly.""

In 2013, Mojang brought in a reported $326 million in revenue. Asked about the deal, a Microsoft spokesperson told Joystiq, ""We don't comment on rumors or speculation."" We've reached out to Mojang for clarification."
1033,"Raven-Symone did NOT file molestation charges against Bill Cosby. A hoax report that has gone viral amid renewed rape allegations against Cosby claims the former child star “revealed to the TMZ offices that she too had been raped and drugged” by Cosby following the final episode of “The Cosby Show.” The story is 100 percent false and fake.

The actress herself took to Instagram on Wednesday to shoot down the story: “I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of! Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!”

TMZ has nothing to do with the original phony story. It was started by something called Hip Hop Hangover, an unfunny parody site, and then shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook. Large outlets like the Indian version of International Business Times picked it up and treated the fake allegations like they were real.

The post contains phony quotes from a purported lawyer for Raven-Symone, including a fake press announcement that declares, “We among so many others are tired of the media worshipping and praising a man that has a past so terrible that it is unbelievable. My client (Raven-Symone) is also ready to tell her side of the story. A side that was kept quiet because of threats from being blackballed.” No actual lawyer for the real Raven-Symone ever made such a statement.

Again, Raven-Symone has NOT actually claimed Cosby molested or raped her. The article is a hoax timed to exploit the very serious allegations against Cosby by women including Janice Dickinson and Joan Tarshis. It’s appalling that outlets would spread this “satirical” story about Raven-Symone without checking first."

The Independent has a good explainer on why the video below is fake. 

But if it had been real, the symbolism would have been spot on. During his speech, Putin emphasized a strong belief in promoting peace, even as Russia's policies have only provoked and perpetuated violence in Ukraine and Crimea, which he invaded.

American and British intelligence officials are eyeing a British-born rapper as the militant who beheaded journalist James Foley.

A senior Western intelligence official told Fox News that 23-year-old London rapper Abde Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect believed to be Foley’s executioner.

U.S. intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports, but a well-placed source told Fox News that Bary’s Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa.

Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with ISIS, the source said.

The Sunday Times and Sunday People identified Bary as a member of a group of at least three British-born ISIS fighters known among former hostages as “The Beatles.”

The Sunday Times reported that MI5 and MI6, Britain’s two major intelligence agencies, had identified the man who did the brutal deed, though he had not been publicly identified.

Axl Rose was allegedly found dead in his West Hollywood home at age 52, according to a crazy new report. Could the Guns N’ Roses frontman really have died? Fans seems to be completely shocked — and confused.


Axl Rose Dead — Guns N’ Roses Frontman Dies In West Hollywood Home?
Don’t worry! This report is a hoax. Axl proved he’s not dead by addressing the situation on Twitter a few hours ago.


At least he has a sense of humor about the death rumor!

The fake story came from a site called MSNBC.website.com, which was designed to look like an MSNBC report. However, the two have no connection whatsoever.

The headline from the bogus story reads: “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”

“Unconfirmed reports say Rose was found dead Tuesday late afternoon in his West Hollywood home after police were called around 3:30 pm for a welfare check,” the story claims. The report then goes on to say a police spokesperson said, “The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area.”

The website pulled a similar prank in November, when it claimed Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin had died. That story also proved to be fake!

1171,"When Oliver Ilic's girlfriend broke up with him and told him he's not very good in bed, he had an extreme post-breakup reaction and chopped off his penis. Yikes.

He told doctors that his girlfriend had complained about the size of his manhood, which led to him grabbing a razor blade and mutilating himself.

But when the bleeding wouldn't stop, Ilic knew it was time to get some help, so he called emergency services and was taken away in an ambulance. Police discovered the severed organ sitting in the bin, and one five-hour operation later, the penis was reattached.

However, doctors say it's still too early to tell if the surgery was a success, and it remains to be seen if Ilic will regain full use of the organ.

We're just glad to hear that Ilic is on the road to recovery - he must have felt truly traumatised to harm himself in such a way."

The rumor was perhaps more believable after an incident last week, when ultra-Orthodox Jewish men delayed an Israel-bound Delta flight because they refused to sit next to female passengers.

And Saudi Arabia has persistent gender disparities: The World Economic Forum ranked Saudi Arabia 127th out of 136 countries for women's rights in its Global Gender Gap Report in 2013.

There are restrictions on women — for example, they are not permitted to drive in the country — however there have also been signs of recent change. Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah announced in 2011 that women would be able to vote in 2015 elections.

Saudia is a member of the SkyTeam alliance.

1215,"""We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that’s Chris Bale.""

Christian Bale didn’t have to audition to win the role of late Apple CEO Steve Jobs in an upcoming biopic, says screenwriter Aaron Sorkin.

“Well, there was a meeting,” Sorkin told Bloomberg Television in an interview confirming that the Dark Knight star will play Jobs. “We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that’s Chris Bale.”

Sorkin, the writer behind television shows like The West Wing and The Newsroom, is adapting Walter Isaacson’s 2011 biography for the big screen, four years after rendering Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, in the film The Social Network.

The Academy Award winning Bale was rumored to have won the role over other possible contenders, including Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Leonardo Dicaprio, according to The Verge.

But Sorkin confirmed in the interview posted Thursday that Bale will fill the challenging role.

“He has more words to say in this movie than most people have in three movies combined,” Sorkin said. “There isn’t a scene or a frame that he’s not in. So it’s an extremely difficult part and he is gonna crush it.”"
1220,"International Business Machines Corp. is reportedly on the cusp of laying off about 26% of its 430,000-strong workforce, or 111,800 people, as part of its biggest-ever corporate restructuring.

The unconfirmed report from Forbes suggests that U.S. employees will be “hit hard” in the overhaul, code-named Project Chrome, but that the layoffs will stretch to many of the company’s “worldwide service operations.”

In his report, long-time Silicon Valley journalist Robert X. Cringely writes that the massive cuts will start this week and be completed by the end of February.

The layoffs would be the largest in the company’s history, topping 60,000 jobs it cut in 1993.

IBM shares rose 2%, or US$3.13, to US$159.00 in early morning trading in New York.

Cringely’s report suggests that Project Chrome has been in the works since before Christmas and is likely being rolled out now in response to IBM’s announcement last week of its 11th straight quarter of falling revenue.

Revenue fell 12% in the fourth quarter, shrinking across every reported unit and every geography.

The technology and consulting company has struggled as business customers have moved away from buying big mainframe computers and traditional software that’s installed on their own systems.

IBM has been spending heavily to develop new products, such as data analytics and artificial intelligence programs and “cloud” software that IBM delivers to customers over the Internet. But those new businesses have not grown as fast as the company hoped, while revenue has continued to fall in IBM’s traditional software, hardware and technology services businesses.

Cringely paints the coming cuts as a “pure accounting resource action” engineered by executives and “designed to make IBM’s financials look better for the next few quarters.”

1222,"Not news: A fabricated story coming out of North Korea. News: It's not North Korea doing the fabricating!

It's being widely reported that Kim Jong-Un is considering Scotland for his next restaurant venture, which will feature dog meat on the menu. What's not being reported is... well, anyone ever saying that in the first place.

We're here to help you, the reader, mull through all the hot garbage being served up today by telling you exactly what we know, and pointing out the news organizations that are spreading misinformation. Yes, it's FACT or SHITE time!

FACT: Kim Jong-Un already has a restaurant in Amsterdam. Kim Jong-Un's regime opened a North Korean chain restaurant called Pyongyang in Amsterdam in 2012. It was eventually closed down but reopened under the name Haedanghwa, according to CNBC. It also gets better-than-average Yelp reviews, and features noodles with bean paste and fried scallops. Yum!

FACT: A reporter for the Scotland Daily Post wants the dictator to open a restaurant in Scotland, but has no proof of a plan to do so. Let's break down the facts in the Sunday Post article. Reporter Gordon Blackstock asks, ""Is dictator Kim Jong-un planning to open a restaurant in Scotland?"" He claims that North Korea indeed has Scotland ""in its crosshairs"" -- a particularly bad metaphor to associate with a militaristic dictator. His source is a blogger with the North Korea Leadership Watch (which has no official ties to Kim Jong-Un). This blogger allegedly said that ""it would not surprise me if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.""

FACT: That blogger never actually said a restaurant is opening in Scotland. In fact, that blogger, Michael Madden, told The Huffington Post that the whole story is...

SHITE: Kim Jong-Un plans to open a restaurant in Scotland. Madden, who didn't even write up the story on his own blog, says that the use of his quote is misleading.

""Kim Jong Un is most certainly not thinking of opening restaurants anywhere,"" he told HuffPost Weird News. ""In terms of the sourcing I have nary a clue; this could come from local partners in Scotland floating a trial balloon or deliberately disseminated disinformation. If DPRK entities are thinking of opening restaurants in Europe, the UK, or the Republic of Ireland, Scotland would likely be on the short list which is what I said last week.""

FACT: ""News"" travels fast. The Daily Mail wrote up the fabricated story -- presumably off of the Sunday Post story, because it features the same quotes from Madden -- and then the internet went crazy. CNBC and Edinburgh News aggregated it, resulting in this reporter's editor going absolutely bonkers trying to figure out why we didn't have this story. We didn't have this story because it was never true.

FACT: If Kim Jong-Un were planning to open a restaurant in Europe, Scotland would ""likely be on the short list."" That's cool! But nobody ever said he plans to open anything. Heck, even if he did, the western version of the restaurant wouldn't feature dog meat like their North Korean counterparts reportedly do. We know this, because the Sunday Post's ""experts"" know this -- their experts being Michael Madden, a blogger who wouldn't touch this fake story with a 10-foot pole.

FACT: If Kim Jong-Un does open a restaurant in Scotland, we'll be embarrassed. But given the information we have now, there's no way we expect to see ""Pyongyang"" in Scotland.

Alex's parents fear they may be dragged into a court battle - all because their son chose a day out with his grandparents over a pal's birthday party

Just before the Christmas holidays, Alex, their son, was invited to a classmate’s Birthday party at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre.

Alex, who goes to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School, told his parents he wanted to go and so Mr Nash and his partner confirmed he would be at the celebration.

Mr Nash said: “She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.”

But Mr Nash later realised he had arranged for Alex and his sister Lily to out for a day trip with their grandparents.

“By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy’s mother] know,” explained Mr Nash.

“So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do; he chose to be with his grandparents.”

On January 6 Alex went back to school as the new term got under way.

Mr Nash continued: “My partner looked out for [the friend’s mother] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn’t see her.

“But on January 15 she looked in Alex’s school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for £15.95 for a child’s party no show fee.

The bill Alex brought home. He was not charged VAT on his birthday party no-show...

“I asked Alex’s class teacher if [the child’s mother] had given anything to her. She said, ‘Yes, a brown envelope’.

“I then visited Alex’s school headteacher, who couldn’t apologise enough that one of the teachers had passed this on.

“She said she would remind all staff that this was a breach of protocol.”

“I left the school and went to see [the birthday boy’s mother] as her address was on the invoice.

“When she answered the door I told her I had found the invoice in my son’s school bag and that I wasn’t happy about it.

“I told her I would not be paying her the money.

“I told her she should have spoken to me first and not put the invoice in my son’s school bag.”

He added: “I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up, but I just can’t believe the way she has gone around it.”

The couple claim that the mother of Alex’s friend has threatened the couple with taking the case to the small claims court.

And five-year-old Alex has told his parents that his classmate will no longer play with him after he didn’t show up to the party.


Poor Alex says his friend will no longer play with him at school since the row broke out

Mr Nash said: “I drive all around the South West for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this.

“They’re all quite incredulous that this has happened.

“I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words.”

Mr Nash’s partner has been in contact with the mum via Facebook hoping to resolve the situation.

The mother of Alex’s friend was unavailable for comment when contacted by The Herald.


Full Facebook conversation between Alex's mum Tanya and the birthday boy's mum Julie.

Tanya Walsh

Hi Julie. This is Alex's mum. I don't know what has happened between you and my partner, Derek. I was very shocked to see the invoice in Alex's school bag. I did not realise that you had to pay for each child, as you never mentioned anything about money when we spoke. The only reason Alex did not attend the party was because his nan and grandad were going away for christmas and the only day the kids could go see them was on the same day as the party. I did not know this. On the day Alex decided that he wanted to spend time with his nan and grandad. I apologise for not letting you know, but I did not have a phone number or an e-mail for you to let you know the situation(I also didn't know your first name, or I would have looked you up). If I had known that I would have to pay if Alex did not go, then I would have paid you the money, no problem. I do not like fighting with people, and would prefer to settle this amicably.

Julie Lawrence

Hi Tanya, I didn't mention the money when we spoke because it was a child's party, it doesn't matter if you have to pay per person or for a group if people agree to going, I confirmed that with all parents on the Thursday before the party that they were going as I had to pay that day, and Derek told me Alex was looking forward to it and would see us there, to me that is confirmation. My phone number was on the invitation that was sent out to Alex. I don't like fighting with people either, and was not best impressed when Derek turned up on my doorstep, and said you won't get any money out of me, rather rudely, I do admit it rattled me. This is not the first time Alex has not turned up to a party that he has been invited to, either. the amicable way round this I believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt, I hope this is agreeable ? Julie

Tanya Walsh

Hi Julie, who's party is Alex supposed to have gone to? I did speak to another mum about a party but she never got back to me with details, other than that I don't recall any other confirmed invites. The only reason Derek was angry was because of the fact that the envelope was put into Alex's school bag, when it has nothing to do with the school. He spoke to the headteacher about and she said that it's against school policy to do that kind of thing. Birthday invites are fine, but not personal items. Like I said before, no money was mentioned when we spoke, and I feel it would be inappropriate to pay you the money, when I don't know what it's actually paying for. Alex was very excited to go to the party. I didn't know until the day about his nan and grandad, and he decided he would rather spend the day with them. Like I said before I didn't have your number to let you know. And exactly what lesson would I be learning. I am not a child, so please do not speak to me like I am one. So, to answer your question, unfortunately no. This is not agreeable.

Julie Lawrence

You are paying for 1 x child's party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch, to with you said Alex was attending on the Thursday

Tanya Walsh

Just so you know, small claims court cost #60 just to start a claim. Also I'm not paying for something we didn't use.

Julie Lawrence

It doesn't cost that much

Tanya Walsh

It does. Also I don't think the school are very happy with you involving them in this either. I don't know why you are out for our blood and slandering us. I've told you the reasons why alex didn't go. I also told you why I couldn't call. You also don't seem to understand that I never ran away from you. I didnt hear you calling after me. I have to get to my daughter at carbeile. So if they let alex out last then I have to rush a bit because evie, my 2 year old, walks slow. So maybe that's why you thought I was rushing off. I had no reason to run to run away from you. So please do not state things as truth when you do not have all the facts. Maybe if you actually spoke to me rather than making your own mind up about what happened then none of this would be happening right now. If you had come up to us the first day back and explained about the money, then I could have explained about alex, then maybe we could have sorted something out. Instead you send an invoice."

1255,"The CBI registered a case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in connection with the alleged forced castration of 400 men

The CBI has registered a case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda, in connection with the alleged forced castration of 400 of his followers.

The agency has registered a case of criminal conspiracy against the Dera chief and his other followers for voluntarily causing grievous hurt with dangerous weapons, among other charges, under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) .

The case has been registered on the orders of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

A petition was filed in the high court in 2012 by a follower of Dera demanding a CBI inquiry and compensation for his alleged castration in 2000, CBI spokesperson Kanchan Prasad said.

Prasad added that petitioner Hansraj Chauhan has alleged that around 400 male devotees, including himself, belonging to Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, were castrated at the Dera after its head (Ram Rahim) falsely claimed that the castration would lead to “realisation of God through him”.

Justice K. Kannan of the high court passed the order on the petition ordering a CBI inquiry into the incident.

The court had earlier ordered a medical examination of the petitioner from the government multi-speciality hospital which found that he had indeed been castrated.

In a report submitted before the HC, the state government had said that it has recorded the statements of seven persons associated with the Dera head and all of them have confirmed that they have been castrated."

“We have confirmed that Ahmed Godane, the co-founder of al-Shabaab, has been killed,” said rear admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, describing it as a “major symbolic and operational loss” for the militant group, which aligned itself with al-Qaida.

Al-Shabaab is fighting to topple Somalia’s western-backed government and regularly launches bombings and gun attacks against state targets and civilians. Godane’s death could now lead to an internal power struggle.

On Wednesday US officials had said they were still investigating to see whether the strike on an al-Shabaab encampment had killed Godane, 37, who reportedly trained with the Taliban in Afghanistan.

At least three strikes hit a convoy of al-Shabaab vehicles in southern Somalia on Monday night, according to witnesses and a spokesman for the group who spoke later with the Associated Press. The al-Shabaab representative said that six al-Shabaab fighters had been killed in the strikes.

The air raid came days after African Union (AU) troops and Somali government forces launched “Operation Indian Ocean”, a major offensive aimed at seizing key ports from al-Shabaab and cutting off one of their key sources of revenue: multi-million dollar exports of charcoal. AU forces were targeting Shabaab on several fronts, with Ugandan troops leading the offensives against the main port of Barawe, south of the capital, Mogadishu.

The commander of the AU in Somalia has said the death of Godane would be a “proud and happy moment for all Africa”.

Godane, who has a passion for poetry, seized world attention a year ago with the Westgate mall attack in Nairobi, which left at least 67 dead. He warned Kenya that it would suffer further atrocities unless it withdrew its troops from the AU force in Somalia.

“You cannot withstand a war of attrition inside your own country,” he said in an audio message posted on a website linked to al-Shabaab. “So withdraw all your forces, or be prepared for an abundance of blood that will be spilt in your country.”

Washington has carried out a series of drone missile strikes in the past, including attacks reportedly targeting Godane, but rarely confirms this officially.

Godane took over the leadership of al-Shabaab in 2008 after then chief Adan Hashi Ayro was killed by a US missile strike.

Also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, Godane was al-Shabaab’s spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al-Qaida. In 2012 the US offered a reward of up to $7m (£4.2m) for information leading to his arrest."
1258,"TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh was surprised to find psychedelic mushrooms which cause vivid hallucinations growing in the garden at Buckingham Palace.

The presenter found the red and white spotted toadstool called Amanita muscaria while filming an ITV gardening show called The Queen's Garden and said: 'I won't be eating any of that.'

He was touring the private 40-acre site with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley and asked him whether the fungus is edible.

Professor Crawley replied saying: 'That depends what you mean. It's eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic effects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

The red and white spotted toadstool called Amanita muscaria can cause vivid hallucinations and is known for the unpredictability of its effects

'The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.'

Titchmarsh jokingly replied: 'I think I'll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.'

The fungus, also known as fly agaric, contains the psychoactive chemicals ibotenic acid and muscimol and they can be found throughout the UK.

Last night a Palace spokesman was keen to point out the fungus is not served to Royals.

He said: 'There are several hundred fungi species in the palace garden, including a small number of naturally occurring fly agaric mushrooms.

'As the programme explains, they are beneficial to trees, increasing their ability to take in nutrients.'

He told the Sun: 'For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.'

This type of fungus can often be found growing under birch or pine trees, especially Monterey and Bishop pine which are common in the garden at Buckingham Palace.

With permission from Her Majesty The Queen, Alan Titchmarsh spent a whole year exploring the Buckingham Palace Garden, which has a five-century history.

On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools.

He said: 'Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.'

During her reign, Her Majesty has made the garden a place where nature thrives. It now plays host to 350 species of wildflower, 83 species of bird and two and a half thousand British species of insect, including butterflies.

It's been the garden of Queen Elizabeth II for longer than any other monarch. A rare film from 1937 shows the Queen as an 11-year-old princess with her younger sister princess Margaret, having just moved into the palace.

Mr Titchmarsh heard tales about the Queen's childhood from royal historian Dr Lucy Worsley, who explains that the young princesses held a wistful fascination with what was beyond the garden walls.

Amanita muscaria, also known as fly agaric, can cause vivid hallucinations

Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is one of the most recognisable and widely encountered mushrooms in popular culture.

The white-spotted, usually red mushroom is viewed as the quintessential toadstool and can be found throughout Europe and America, often growing under birch and pine trees.

The fungus is well-known for its hallucinogenic properties because it has a high level of a psycoactive agent called muscimol.

Historically the mushrooms were used by medicine men or ‘shamans’ of north east Asia.

There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in Siberia, the Middle East, India, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.

Fly agarics are known for the unpredictability of their effects as they can change dramatically depending on the habitat and the amount ingested per body weight.

Effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions and mood swings.

It can cause vivid hallucinations, often making colours seem oversaturated and breaking up the boundaries between objects. Some users report having spiritual experiences.

The fungi are often considered poisonous and a fatal dose has been calculated as 15 caps.

The sale of fresh and prepared magic mushrooms containing psilocin or psilocybin has been illegal in Ireland since January 2006."
1269,"JJ Abrams is considering releasing his heavily anticipated Star Wars: The Force Awakens this summer, according to unconfirmed reports from Ikwiz and Movie Pilot. The film has a current release date of December 18 2015.

According to Movie Pilot, the director is losing patience with the constant stream of plot and image leaks from the Star Wars set, and believes that shifting to an earlier release date will mean the film isn't ""ruined"" before fans can see it. The Ikwiz article states: ""Disney is reportedly taking Abrams’ request very seriously, and is looking at a possible summer release.""

While neither website has an official source for the rumour, Abrams is reported to have made the comments at the 2015 Visual Effects Society Awards on February 4. The director received the VES Visionary Award during the ceremony.

Last week, Disney appeared to be cracking down on anyone illegally leaking content from Star Wars VII, requesting that a judge issue a subpoena to a website named ImageShack, which was hosting a blurred image of a Sith Lord clutching a red lightsaber – said to be a leaked still from the film. In a declaration to support the issuance of a subpoena, a Disney employee confirmed the image was related to Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

1271,"Axl Rose is not dead, despite internet reports to the contrary — but that should come as no surprise to fans who by now have surely grown tired of the seemingly endless stream of online hoaxes falsely reporting the death of just about every major celebrity, and plenty of minor celebs as well.

The Axl Rose death hoax started on a bogus site forged to look like a page on the MSNBC website. The authentic looking — at a cursory glance, anyway — story was headlined, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52,” and claimed that the “Welcome To The Jungle” singer was found dead after police were called to check on the former rock star’s welfare.

Perhaps in a vain attempt to add an air of authenticity to the latest death hoax, the phony story on the ersatz MSNBC site claimed the death of Axl Rose remained “unconfirmed.”

“It’s fake, dude,” wrote the site Mediaite, in its story mocking the Axl Rose death hoax. “You can go ahead and confirm it.”

The site Gossip Cop, which specializes in debunking rumors about celebrities — dead or alive — was among the first to expose the fakery, which apparently fooled numerous internet users with its convincing-looking URL, “msnbc.website.”

“The awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories,” reported Gossip Cop. “Enough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website.”

In addition to Home Alone star Culkin, and today’s hogwash “Axl Rose is dead” prank, other celebrities victimized by death hoaxes recently have included “Dog Whisperer” Cesar Millan, ’80s “Brat Pack” actor Judd Nelson, and TV Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno.

While Axl Rose and his representatives have not confirmed that the “Paradise City” crooner is actually still living and breathing, but they probably don’t need to. But one thing is certain. Axl Rose may be the latest, but will certainly not be the last “dead” but-not-really celebrity to be the subject of a yet another tiresome online death hoax."
1277,"When Apple unveiled its first smartwatch earlier this month, the company told us a lot about its design, customization options, and the type of features we can expect. What we didn't hear about, however, is the technology Apple will use to power the watch.

Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri spoke with Apple's supply chain to learn that the Apple Watch will most likely come in two different storage capacities: 4GB and 8GB. Arcuri revealed this information in a note to investors, according to Apple Insider.

Arcuri believes the 4GB edition will be the more popular mainstream version, noting that the 8GB watch probably won't be the default configuration. This means you'll be able to store apps, messages, fitness data, and other types of files and information directly on the watch.

That amount of storage space is fairly standard for smartwatches. Both Samsung's Gear 2 and Sony's Smartwatch 3 also come with 4GB of storage space. This means that if Apple does release an 8GB version, it'll offer twice as much storage as current smartwatches.

Arcuri's supply chain sources also said the wireless chip inside Apple's watch would come with a GPS radio, which is odd given that Apple said its watch would need to be connected to an iPhone to use GPS data. This chip will reportedly be similar to the wireless chip found inside the iPhone 5s, Arcuri wrote.

The Apple Watch won't be released until early 2015, so we expect to learn more about it over the next several months.

1279,"NEW YORK—Oil prices jumped Wednesday on unconfirmed rumors in the market that a pipeline exploded in Saudi Arabia, raising fears that the country’s crude production and exports could be curtailed.

A spokesperson for Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s oil company, told The Wall Street Journal that the company has seen the rumors, which circulated on Twitter, but isn’t able to confirm them.

Prices have been sliding for months on concerns that the market is oversupplied and that Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil exporter, is unlikely to cut production to raise prices.

1294,"Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister of North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, has allegedly taken over state duties while her brother receives medical treatment. Her responsibilities include handling important government decisions while her brother undergoes treatment at Bonghwa Clinic in North Korea's capital Pyongyang, according to media reports. No specific information on his alleged health troubles have been made public.

""Some say Hwang Byong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,"" said Kim Heung Gwang, the head of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, according to the Diplomat, a magazine based in Tokyo.

Kim Yo-jong is the daughter of the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. She was only officially mentioned for the first time on March 9 and was later identified as a senior official in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, according to Ria Novosti, the Russian news agency.

The Associated Press reported earlier this month on the supreme leader's notable absence from a Supreme People’s Assembly meeting broadcast on state television, apparently the first time he's missed the meeting since taking office in December 2011 after the sudden death of his father and predecessor. North Korean state media has acknowledged rumors of illness by saying that the 31-year-old leader was experiencing “discomfort,” without going into further detail.

Media reports have speculated that he has gout, underwent ankle surgery, or is suffering from health problems after eating too much cheese."
1312,"Nouakchott — The Tripoli airport siege led to the disappearance of several commercial planes. Now countries on both shores of the Mediterranean are worried about how the missing aircraft might be used by terrorists.

Rival militias have fought for control of the airport since mid-July, inflicting civilian casualties and extensive damage. But one unusual consequence of the ongoing battle has nearly a dozen countries on edge.

After eleven civilian airliners were hijacked during the fighting, ""5+5"" member states reportedly decided to add an element to their scheduled joint military exercise. This time, simulations will include intercepting civilian or military aircraft piloted by terrorists.

The air forces of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritania, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy and Malta will participate in the upcoming exercise, in co-ordination with US naval forces stationed in the Mediterranean and Italy, Anatolia news agency reported on Monday, (August 18th).

""Libya was finally excluded because of the deteriorating security situation"", Reporters.DZ quoted the Turkish agency as saying.

The objective of the exercise is to counter potential threats, such as the kind of suicide attacks seen on September 11, 2001, Sahara Media reported Monday.

Libya in recent months has become a hotbed for the most dangerous terrorists in the Sahel region. These include veteran jihadists who migrated to Libya after fighting in Syria.

""These terrorist elements are present in abundance in Libya and have gotten sophisticated weapons by buying them from smugglers, professional armed militias or even ordinary citizens,"" analyst Yakoub Mustafa told Magharebia. This volatile situation requires security partnerships among multiple countries, he added.

According to Moroccan reporter Youssef Lakhdar, ""Co-ordination must be at all levels and not only when an imminent danger is coming.""

If Maghreb countries had coalesced sooner, the security chaos in Libya might have been averted, he said.

""Libya is now a source of danger not only for neighbouring Maghreb countries but for all countries of the world,"" Lakhdar added.

The issue of Maghreb security came up August 15th, when African leaders attended the 70th anniversary commemoration of the Allied invasion of southern France during World War II.

Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was among the African leaders and WWII veterans invited to watch naval parades and air shows near Toulon.

His participation comes within the framework of strengthening security, military and economic co-operation between Mauritania and France, noted journalist Mohammed Yacoub Ould Moustafa.

""Many sons of the colonies participated in World War II,"" he added.

""This is why the presence of the Mauritanian president for this celebration is in recognition of Mauritania's efforts, in addition to the security policies connecting France with the countries of the Sahel,"" he said."

One person said; ""The spray paint is almost an improvement"", while another wrote; ""If you can afford a Bugatti, you can afford to park it in a secure lot.""

But others condemned the graffiti artist for vandalism.

1340,"Boko Haram thinks all the truce talk is hilarious. At least that is what it seems like judging from a video released Friday to Nigerian media that purported to show the terrorist group’s leader Abubakar Shekau laughing off claims that it had reached a ceasefire with the government and that the more than 200 girls the group kidnapped six months ago were close to being released. “A lie,” Shekau said. ""We married them off. They are in their marital homes,"" he said, chuckling, according to CNN. He then added that the girls converted to Islam and “have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.” In fact, the whole issue about the kidnapped girls has been “long forgotten,” he added.

In the video, Shekau said he had no idea whom the supposed negotiator was who supposedly worked out a cease-fire deal with the government on behalf of the Islamist group. ""We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,"" he said of the negotiator. He also threatened to kill a captured German hostage, who is “always crying.” He added that the extremist group could “hack him or slaughter him or shoot him,” reports the Associated Press.

Throughout the rambling speech, Shekau, who “bristled with theatrical rage,” talked about everything from the “Islamic State to obscure Nigerian politicians to a threat to ‘eat the heart of infidels,’ ” reports the Wall Street Journal. Yet more than what he said, the mere release of a video is bad news for President Goodluck Jonathan, whose administration had touted the cease-fire on the campaign trail. Jonathan is expected to win a second term in February."
1343,"Rumors of Ebola turned out to be far more contagious than the virus itself this weekend as online media whipped up a feverish story, later disproven, of a suspected Ebola case in Kansas City.

After appearing on a local blog and a Wichita television website Saturday night, the rumor went viral, spreading to such national outlets as Breitbart.com.

Then on Sunday afternoon, a spokeswoman for Research Medical Center issued a statement:

“We have seen online reports that a patient at Research Medical Center is suspected of having Ebola. These reports are inaccurate. Research Medical Center is caring for a patient who presented to our Brookside Campus emergency department, however, the patient does not have the symptom profile of Ebola.”

That was followed Monday by a statement from the Kansas City Health Department: “The Health Department has ruled out the presence of Ebola in Kansas City.”

“There was a social media frenzy about the possibility of Ebola in Kansas City,” said Jeff Hershberger, a department spokesman. “We’re still exploring how this happened.”

Hospitals and the general public have been on edge since an Ebola case was diagnosed last week at a hospital in Dallas. Thomas Eric Duncan is in critical condition at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The hospital’s failure to recognize that Duncan may have had Ebola during an earlier visit to its emergency room has heightened vigilance further.

Details about what happened Saturday in Kansas City are still unclear, but a feverish man was taken to Research Medical Center’s Brookside Campus on Saturday night. The man apparently was from Nigeria, a country that has had Ebola cases but is not among the three African countries engulfed in the current epidemic.

The patient’s travel history and fever “triggered them to look at things that included Ebola,” Hershberger said.

Kansas City police said they received a call Saturday night from a nurse who told them the hospital was under lockdown because of suspicions about the patient. The police decided to block access to the patient’s apartment in the 3600 block of East Meyer Boulevard and to keep the vehicle used to take him to the hospital under observation.

“Neighbors saw (the police activity) and got worried and contacted the media,” Hershberger said.

Meantime, the blog TonysKansasCity.com posted the line: “First suspected report of Ebola in Kansas City!!” Tony Botello, who writes the blog, later revised that report.

KCTV-5 broadcast a story Saturday night about the apartment building being locked down because of a potentially contagious disease but never mentioned Ebola, said Darrin McDonald, the station’s vice president and general manager.

If a Wichita station reported it was a case of the Ebola virus, “they connected dots that we never did,” McDonald said.

Gordon Beedle, a news producer at KWCH-12 in Wichita, said the station received information from KCTV about the story and posted its own version online. Beedle said he couldn’t recall exactly what that story said and couldn’t trace it Monday night.

Sunday night, KCTV reported that Kansas City health officials said it was not Ebola.

But on Saturday night, others told a different story, said Christine Hamele, a spokeswoman for HCA Midwest Health, which operates Research Medical Center.

“I was made aware of erroneous reports of a suspected Ebola case in the Kansas City area,” she said. “What was clear to me by 11 p.m. (Saturday) was that none of the information … was accurate.”

Hamele said the patient was transferred from Research’s Brookside Campus to the main hospital, where he was placed in isolation. He responded well to treatment and was released Monday, she said.

“A lot of us are on an extra alert because of what happened in Dallas,” Hershberger said. “What happened this weekend was a situation we would prefer to what happened in Dallas. We prefer extra vigilance to not enough vigilance.”

1346,"THE ISLAMIC State murderer dubbed 'Jihadi John' has been named as Mohammed Emwazi from west London, according to reports.

It is understood that he was known to British security services who chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons.

A close friend of Emwazi told the Washington Post: “I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John.

""He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.""

Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.

Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi's name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ""The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.

""There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.""

Kuwaiti-born Emwazi is believed to have been raised in a middle-class area of west London, at times attending a mosque in Greenwich.

He is understood to have graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Westminster, after which he started to become radicalised.

The Post claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.

It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates.

He is thought to have travelled to Syria in 2012, before joining IS (also known as Isis or Isil), according to the Post.

According to the BBC's Dominic Casciani, Emwazi was a ""person of interest"" to British security services from at least 2011.

He apparently featured in ""semi-secret court cases relating to extremism overseas and back in the UK"".

He is thought to have been responsible for the brutal executions of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, American aid worker Peter Kassig, British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa.

Each killing was publicised in a series of highly-produced video clips.

The masked executioner appeared to speak with a British accent, prompting speculation about his identity.

The killer gained his moniker after being nicknamed 'John' by a group of his hostages.

He was apparently part of a terrorist cell described as 'the Beatles', with other members known as 'George', 'Paul' and 'Ringo'.

Commander Richard Walton of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) said:

""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: ""(The) Prime Minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL (Islamic State) to face justice for the appalling acts carried out.

""There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria.

""It is not appropriate for the Government to comment on any part of it while this continues.”"
1347,"The Apple Watch might be water resistant, according to comments reported by French site iGen (via AppleInsider). Either that or it's a misunderstanding, and we don't really know which. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly told employees at an Apple Store in Berlin that he wears his Apple Watch everywhere, ""even in the shower.""

Apple has not officially designated the Apple Watch as either water proof or water resistant. If Mr. Cook actually said he wears his in the shower, it could indicate that Apple will market the device as one or the other.

The problem is the report is hearsay, and there could be some translation issues. It might even have been a joke. We have no context with which to judge this story. So don't invest too much in this rumor just yet.

In fact, I personally doubt the device is water resistant or proof. Even if the device is sealed, water and touch screens don't typically work well together at all. That would make it a coup for Apple—and if anyone could do it it is Apple—but I'm not expecting a water resistant or proof Apple Watch based on this anecdote.

Then there are the straps. Apple has plastic straps. but I wouldn't want to run the metal ones or leather through a shower.

Bah. I don't like this one at all.

In the meanwhile, Mr. Cook also reportedly says he charges his Apple Watch every night. This is in keeping with the very rough comments from Apple at the device's unveiling in September. At that time, we were told Apple had designed the watch to be charged at night, though the company was unspecific about how long it would actually run.

So yeah, I can believe that hasn't changed, but we still don't have context for the comments."

But now rumours are circulating that the 31-year-old's weakness for cheese is to blame for a debilitating spell of gout which has rendered him immobile.

His last public appearance was on September 3, when he was spotted with a limp.

South Korean news agencies claim he also suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure.
Kim's grandfather Kim Il-sung reportedly had gout, which is a type of arthritis.

It can affect any joints but is most common in the big toe.

Diet can also play a big part, with alcohol and rich foods being the main culprits.

Gout is more common in men and attacks, which usually last between five and 15 days, can go away on their own.

But if left untreated it can lead to kidney stones and cardiovascular disease.

A devoted fish owner in Norfolk, England, took his constipated fish to the veterinarian, only to learn that a lump near its backside was the cause.

The procedure was completed at Toll Barn Veterinary Centre by Faye Bethell, according to BBC News. The procedure cost the fish's owner £300 ($460).

""We've got one nurse who bubbles anesthetic gas through a tube that goes in through its mouth and over its gills, and then we have a second nurse to monitor with a probe to check the heart rate,"" Bethell told BBC News.

Goldfish can live between 10 and 25 years in captivity, with some reported to thrive well into their 30s. The constipated fish in question was a spry two years and 10 months old at the time of the procedure.

The goldfish has reportedly since made a full recovery, free to comfortably swim in circles in a tank for the next seven to 20 years.

1376,"The Department of Homeland Security definitively debunked the persistent right-wing media conspiracy theory that Islamic State fighters have attempted to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, saying the rumor is not supported by any ""credible intelligence"" and knocking the claim that the terrorists have been apprehended at the border as ""categorically false."" 

What began early this summer as an unsubstantiated claim from Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) that ""people that are coming [across the U.S.-Mexico border] from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations,"" (a claim PolitiFact Texas rated ""Pants on Fire""), has morphed into a full-blown right-wing conspiracy theory. Conservative media and elected officials are hyping fears that members of the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL) terrorist group are utilizing the U.S.-Mexico border to enter the U.S. and launch terrorist attacks, a chorus that has only grown louder in the ensuing months to attack immigration reform.

In September, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) claimed to have seen information detailing ""four individuals trying to cross through the Texas border who were apprehended at two different stations that do have ties to known terrorists organizations in the Middle East,"" a story subsequently hyped by Fox News. Nearly a month later, the number had jumped from four terrorists allegedly apprehended to 10.

Fox News' On The Record provided a platform to Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) who claimed to have first-hand knowledge of the terrorists crossing the border. Host Greta Van Susteren replied to Hunter's allegations by asking, ""Do you have any information, or any evidence, that they are actually coming in the southern border now?"" And Hunter responded, ""Yes. ... I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,"" citing information he'd received from border patrol agents.



But the right-wing talking point is ""categorically false,"" according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border security. On October 8, DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron refuted the rumor that Islamic State terrorists had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, telling The New Republic: 

""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" said DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

It remains to be seen whether DHS's facts permeate the right-wing bubble. After hearing the DHS statement, Sean Hannity claimed on his radio program that the agency could not be trusted and suggested it may be lying."
1395,"Apple has asked its suppliers in Asia to make a combined five to six million units of its three Apple Watch models during the first quarter ahead of the product’s release in April, according to people familiar with the matter.

Half of the first-quarter production order is earmarked for the entry-level Apple Watch Sport model, while the mid-tier Apple Watch is expected to account for one-third of output, one of these people said.

Orders for Apple Watch Edition – the high-end model featuring 18-karat gold casing – are relatively small in the first quarter but Apple plans to start producing more than one million units per month in the second quarter, the person said. Analysts expect demand for the high-end watches to be strong in China where Apple’s sales are booming.

Apple Watch Sport will start at $349. Apple hasn’t announced pricing for the other models, but Apple Watch Edition is expected to be among the most expensive products the company has ever sold, likely surpassing the $4,000 Mac Pro computer.

Apple sets production plans based on its forecast of demand for the new product. But Apple quickly adjusts these plans if sales are different than what it estimated. Suppliers say that Apple adjusts its so-called “plan of record” more often and more quickly than any other consumer-electronics company.

The orders are similar to early sales of Apple’s last major all-new product. Apple sold 7.5 million iPads in the six months after it arrived in April 2010.

They indicate that Apple expects its watch to far outpace other wearable devices, from Samsung Electronics 005930.SE -1.31%, LG Electronics 066570.SE +1.15%, Sony, Motorola MSI -0.77% and a host of fitness trackers. Research firm Canalys said last week that just 720,000 smartwatches powered by Android Wear, Google GOOGL +0.60%’s operating system for wearable devices, shipped in the last six months of 2014.

Apple declined to comment.

Apple Watch is the company’s first all-new product since the iPad. During development, the company studied a wide range of advanced health features for the Watch before scaling back its ambition for a device that does a little bit of everything.

Taiwan-based Quanta Computer 2382.TW -0.75%, the sole assembler of Apple Watch, started mass production of the new gadget earlier this year. To get ready for the April launch, thousands of Chinese workers will continue to work round the clock during the Chinese New Year holidays at Quanta’s factory in Changshu, China, said one person."

1409,"IBM is planning a massive reorganization that could see layoffs of as many as 110,000 workers beginning next week, according to a report in Forbes.

Silicon Valley journalist Robert X. Cringely, author of The Decline and Fall of IBM, says the notices could go out as soon as next week after IBM reported shrinking profits for an 11th quarter.

IBM stock falls 7% after it downgrades earnings forecast
The tech giant, which relies on service contracts for a significant portion of its cash flow, is suffering as companies shut down their internal data centres and move services to the cloud.

IBM could lay off 26 per cent of its workforce of 430,000, which would mark the largest corporate layoff in history. Big Blue holds the previous record for huge cuts, after laying off 60,000 workers in 1993.


Cringely predicts the bulk of the layoffs will be in the U.S., and affect mainframe and storage divisions. Citing unnamed sources inside IBM, he says the company has been planning a reorganization dubbed Project Chrome to boost its earnings.

IBM recently announced the new Z13 mainframe, but that is unlikely to protect jobs in the mainframe division.

It also bought cloud services provider Softlayer and is opening cloud data centres around the world, including one in Canada, in an effort to move to a new business model. However, it is behind rivals such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon in adapting to cloud computing.

Cloud offerings at IBM are expected to bring in $3.1 billion on an annualized basis in 2014, only a fraction of IBM’s total $100 billion in revenue last year.

In his book, Cringely blames poor management and lack of vision for IBM’s decline."
1417,"For the last few weeks, the general public has assumed that Tiger Woods hasn’t been playing on Tour because of his back and a dog shit golf game, but PGA Tour golfer, Dan Olsen — don’t worry, I haven’t heard of him before either —  is saying that’s simply not the case. Olsen went on record, during a radio interview with 730 WVFN’s David “Mad Dog” DeMarco, claiming his sources are telling him that Tiger Woods is currently serving a one month suspension for failing a drug test. Later in the interview, Olsen says his sources are “Tour players that are exempt.”

Per Olsen’s interview with 730 WVFN:

“I heard he’s on a month suspension. And it’s kind of a strong witness, a credible person that’s telling me this… It’s not testosterone, but it’s something else. I think when it is all said and done, he is going to surpass Lance Armstrong with…a…infamy.”

Olsen didn’t stop at PED’s. He even goes as far as claiming Tiger Woods has allegedly been using questionable golf balls since the late 1990s. So questionable, in fact, that Nike has paid PGA Tour staff to pick up all the balls so no one get’s the balls.

“Tiger, he’s got some problems now. One of the big problems, Nike’s been giving Tiger a ball that I would almost bet hasn’t been tested…Rory played it too. Remember when Rory signed the Nike deal and he played like an amateur for a year? He was going to fail out of the contract unless he got the high-spin ball too… So if you go to Tour events, Nike pays them, pays the Tour staff and the range staff, they pay them to get all those balls back. That’s why Tiger would never sign a golf ball and give it away… He played a ball that nobody else could play.”

I have personally seen Rory McIlroy throw his golf balls into the stands, so I don’t know how valid this ball claim is. But, WOW. Dan Olsen must have very few fucks left to give if he’s publicly calling out Tiger Woods as a cheater on multiple levels.

Thanks to BroBible writer and PGA Tour caddie, Pinot Pete, for getting this interview on our radar. And while Pinot Pete could not corroborate Olsen’s claim — nor would he probably want to, because LAWSUITS — he did say, “I’ve known Dan Olsen for 10 years. And in all that time, I’ve never known him to stretch the truth.” So there’s that."
1419,"Nigeria's military says it has agreed a ceasefire with Islamist militants Boko Haram - and that the schoolgirls the group has abducted will be released.

Nigeria's chief of defence staff, Alex Badeh, announced the truce. Boko Haram has not made a public statement.

The group has been fighting an insurgency since 2009, with some 2,000 civilians reportedly killed this year.

Boko Haram sparked global outrage six months ago by abducting more than 200 schoolgirls.

The girls were seized in the north-eastern town of Chibok in Borno state, and their continued captivity has led to criticism of the Nigerian government's efforts to secure their release.

Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign said in a tweet on Friday: ""We are monitoring the news with huge expectations.""

'Cautiously optimistic'

Air Chief Marshal Badeh revealed the truce at the close of a three-day security meeting between Nigeria and Cameroon. He said Nigerian soldiers would comply with the agreement.

Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told BBC Focus on Africa that the agreement was sealed after a month of negotiations, mediated by Chad.

As part of the talks, a government delegation twice met representatives of the Islamist group.

Mr Tukur said Boko Haram had announced a unilateral ceasefire on Thursday and the government had responded.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" he said.

""I am cautiously optimistic.""

He said arrangements for their release would be finalised at another meeting next week in Chad's capital, Ndjamena.

The negotiations are said to have the blessing of Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, reports the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja.

Speaking to the BBC, Nigerian government spokesman Mike Omeri said Boko Haram would not be given territory under the ceasefire agreement - and that the government would not reveal what concessions it would make.

""We are inching closer to release of all groups in captivity, including the Chibok girls,"" he said.

Analysis: Will Ross, BBC News, Lagos

Nigerian officials had not given any indication that negotiations with Boko Haram were taking place. Even though there had been rumours of talks in neighbouring Chad, this is a very surprising development.

Many Nigerians are extremely sceptical about the announcement especially as there has been no definitive word from the jihadists.

The military has in the past released statements about the conflict in north-east Nigeria that have turned out to be completely at odds with the situation on the ground.

So many here will only celebrate when the violence stops and the hostages are free.

In May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan imposed a state of emergency in the northern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa, vowing to crush the Islamist insurgency.

But Boko Haram increased its attacks this year.

The group promotes a version of Islam which makes it ""haram"", or forbidden, for Muslims to take part in any political or social activity associated with Western society.

It frequently attacks schools and colleges, which it sees as a symbol of Western culture.

Human Rights Watch has reported that 2,053 civilian were killed in the first half of the year, while Amnesty International estimated that 4,000 people were killed in violence - including Nigerian military operations - in the first seven months of 2014.

Boko Haram is seeking to establish an Islamist state in Nigeria, but its fighters often cross the long and porous border with Cameroon.

Eight Cameroon soldiers and more than 100 Boko Haram militants were killed in fighting in the far north of Cameroon on Friday, Reuters quoted the country's defence ministry as saying.

In July, Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad and Niger agreed to form a 2,800-strong regional force to tackle Boko Haram militants."
1452,"LOS ANGELES (CBS Seattle/AP) — A scorpion stung a woman on the hand just before her flight from Los Angeles to Portland took off.
Flight 567 was taxiing on the runway Saturday night when the passenger was stung, Alaska Airlines spokesman Cole Cosgrove said. The plane returned to the gate, and the woman was checked by medics. She refused additional medical treatment, but she didn’t get back on the plane.
The woman stomped the scorpion to death, and flight attendants checked overhead compartments for any additional unwanted arachnids, Cosgrove said. It’s unclear how the scorpion got on the plane, but the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, where scorpions are common, he said.
The flight then took off at 8:40 p.m., about an hour late.
Members of Oregon State University’s men’s basketball team were on the flight, Cosgrove said.  The team was returning home after losing to USC 68-55.
Oregon State Coach Wayne Tinkle told ESPN that the woman was sitting two rows in front of him.
“The plane was coming from Mexico before us and the scorpion was on the plane,” Tinkle said.  “The woman was a real champ.  She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her, but the needle was stuck.”"
1458,"A rumor on Tuesday claims Apple's upcoming Apple Watch will be priced at $500 for the mid-tier steel model and up to $5,000 for top-end gold ""Edition"" versions, a number much higher than previous estimates.

Citing an unnamed source, French website iGen reports Apple is looking to field the Apple Watch at a proposed retail cost of $500 for versions with stainless steel cases and between $4,000 and $5,000 for Apple Watch Edition models. This leaves the Apple Watch Sport version as Apple's lowest-priced option, which the company said would come in at $350.

While the website has been accurate in predicting recent Apple product launches, the claims are unverifiable and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Previous estimates from jewelers and industry analysts pegged high-end Apple Watch Edition models at $1,200. Edition versions are crafted from 18-karat gold, feature sapphire crystal and come with a variety of luxurious strap options. Apple has not commented on whether the entire chassis is solid gold, or merely gold plated, but the company apparently developed a variant of the metal twice as strong as the standard.

Additionally, the source claims Apple is still shooting for a launch on Valentine's Day.

Prior to the Apple Watch announcement, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo accurately predicted that the device would come in two sizes and multiple models spread across a wide range of price points. At the time, he speculated the wearable could cost into the ""thousands of dollars.""

Apple announced its anticipated first foray into the wearables market in September, saying only that pricing would start at $350. Given that the Apple Watch Sport is made from relatively low-cost materials — aluminum, elastomer band and non-sapphire window — many believe it to be the entry-level model."
1462,"Nurses found the woman - who is believed to suffer mental health problems - biting her new son on the arm

Shocked medics have described the moment they found a mum apparently trying to EAT her baby days after he was born.

A nurse found the woman, named locally as 24-year-old Li Zhenghua, with her jaws clamped firmly around the infant's arm.

She raised the alarm and tried to pull the baby free, but the mum refused to let go.

Doctors were forced to use an implement to prize her off the child before administering a sedative.

The shocking cannibalistic attack happened at a hospital in the city of Shenzhen in southern China’s Guangdong Province, where the woman had been discovered heavily pregnant and in labour on the street.

CEN   Investigation: Hospital bosses are now trying to decide whether to return the baby to the mother

She had been taken into the hospital and had given birth, and then placed in a ward where attempts had been made to contact her family as she was left to nurse the child.

However on the woman's third day in hospital, nurse Liu Tianlun had gone into the bedroom to find the young mother biting her son on the arm.

A hospital spokesman said: ""It was really shocking, the arm was badly damaged and suffered not only heavy bruising but bleeding as a result of the bite.

""Fortunately, doctors managed to insert something to stop her closing her teeth and then levered her jaws apart.

""After that they gave her a sedative and took the baby to a secure location.""

CEN   Tragic: Doctors said the woman had been living on the street before she gave birth

Police said the woman had been identified as 24-year-old Li Zhenghua.

They said enquiries had found that, despite being pregnant, her mother-in-law had thrown her out on the street after Li started behaving oddly.

The family did not alert anybody that Li was pregnant and might be in need of help.

She had apparently survived on the streets for at the very least several weeks and possibly longer before she was spotted in labour and the alarm was raised.

An investigation is now going on to decide what prompted the woman's actions and whether the child should be taken into the care of the authorities."

1572,"Multiple users of anonymous web browser Tor have reported that Comcast has threatened to cut off their internet service unless they stop using the legal software.

According to a report on Deepdotweb, Comcast customer representatives have branded Tor ""illegal"" and told customers that using it is against the company's policies.

Tor is a type of web browser that, in theory, makes all your internet activity private. The software routes traffic through a series of other connected internet users, making it difficult for governments and private companies to monitor your internet usage. Up to 1.2 million people use the browser, which became especially popular after Edward Snowden leaked information showing that the NSA was eavesdropping on ordinary citizens. Prior to that, Tor had been popular among people transacting business on Silk Road, the online market for drugs and hitmen.

The problem is that downloading or using Tor itself isn't illegal. Plenty of people might have legitimate reasons to want to surf the web in private, without letting others know what they were looking at. But Tor has been pretty popular with criminals.

Comcast has reportedly begun telling users that it is an ""illegal service."" One Comcast representative, identified only as Kelly, warned a customer over his use of Tor software, DeepDotWeb reports:

Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.

Comcast customers, speaking to Deepdotweb, claimed that Comcast repeatedly asked them which sites they were accessing using Tor.

In a statement to Deepdotweb, Comcast defended its actions, seemingly asserting that it needs to be able to monitor internet traffic in case they receive a court order:

We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customer’s account with a valid court order. And if we’re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.

1594,"(Update: The story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts.) News has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near Managua, Nicaragua late Saturday night, just 13 hours or so before the close flyby of 20-m asteroid 2014 RC, leading some to suggest that the two events are related. However, according to experts who have been examining the evidence, including those at NASA, the two events are completely unrelated, and the explosion in Managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space.

According to the Nicaraguan news site el19digital.com, an explosion occurred around 11:05 p.m. Saturday night, in the city of Managua, which apparently produced a crater that was over 12 metres (39 feet) wide and about 1.5 metres (5 feet) deep, in a wooded area just to the west of the city's international airport, and just south of the Pan-American Highway.

The video below, from RT.com, shows military personnel investigating the crater, as well as the surrounding area, for potential debris from the explosion.
While the incident is still being investigated, officials with Nicaragua's Institute of Territorial Studies (INET), which monitors earthquake activity in the country, said that the event showed up on the agency's seismic instruments.

""We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact,"" Wilfried Strauch from INET said in a press conference, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). ""You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound.""

However, while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion, the scientists have the seismic data from it, and they have the resulting crater, there are parts of the story that just don't add up.

A 20-metre wide asteroid named 2014 RC passed by Earth on Sunday, flying underneath the planet (from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere), and while there is roughly a 13-hour difference in the timing of these two events, some saw a potential connection between these events. It's not entirely unreasonable to suggest this. There are over 11,000 known near-Earth asteroids flying around the Sun, and very likely millions that we haven't detected (and likely won't, because they're too small). While most of these follow their own path as they circle the Sun, not all are alone. Some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them. Some are best described as 'rubble piles', which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulder-like shape by their mutual gravity. Others can be travelling along in 'packs' with some members preceding or lagging behind the 'pack leader' - possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point. So, if one of these asteroid 'packs' is flying by, or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit, it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground.

However, just because two events - an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact - happen close to one another, doesn't mean that they are related. We saw this back in mid-February 2013, when we were watching asteroid 2012 DA14 sweep by Earth and suddenly a 20-m wide asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia. The exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence. 

According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Near Earth Object Office, that appears to be the case for this event:
A meteorite without the meteor?

An interesting fact about this supposed 'impact' is that, although the explosion was heard throughout the area, apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it. When a meteoroid enters the atmosphere, even if it is just a speck of dust, it is traveling so fast (typically around 17 kilometres per second or over 60,000 km/h) that it heats up the air in front of it, causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor. Larger objects cause even brighter flashes, earning them the name fireball,or even bolide (for an exceptionally large and bright one). Some of these are so bright that they can, very briefly, turn night into day as they pass overhead.

Given the weather over Managua on Saturday night (scattered clouds and calm winds), it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky, especially when it happened near a city of over 2 million people.

According to the Associated Press, Strauch said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""

Was it something else?

This lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story. While nearly all meteorites go through a 'dark flight' phase during the final part of their journey to Earth's surface - after it has slowed down enough that it isn't compressing the air enough to cause it to glow - their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere, some 20 to 30 kilometres above the ground, making them visible far and wide across the countryside.

Geoff Nodkin, professional meteorite hunter and host of Science Channel's Meteorite Men, tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic:
Notkin further commented that if it was meteorite-related, he would expect there to be a very bright fireball, sonic booms during the object's dark flight and then the impact. He also said that, to produce a crater like the one seen, it would have to be an iron meteorite, as they are the densest and ""have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on Earth""

In an interview with National Geographic, Donald Yeomans, the author of Near-Earth Objects: Finding Them Before They Find Us, said: ""There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion, so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact.""

So, what was this, if it wasn't a meteorite? One very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion, as there are still thousandsIn cas buried throughout the country, remnants of the war fought there in the 1980s.

While this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time, it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day, as tons of material is swept up by Earth as the planet orbits the Sun. Many of these are missed because they occur during the day, or over regions of the planet that aren't heavily populated. Some countries have all-sky camera networks to capture these events, with data being reported on sites like SpaceWeather.com (U.S.) and the University of Western Ontario (Canada). As an example, there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in Managua, but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the Atlantic Ocean, over eastern Spain, as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video (note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one):"
1604,"Here's a sentence you probably never thought you'd read: Mittens, a hermaphroditic cat from Newfoundland, is getting gender assignment surgery. Colleen Clarke-Murphy's daughter brought the stray cat home, and when the family took it to the vet, they were told it has both male and female genitalia, CBC reports.

Mittens' dual gender has caused the cat to have bowel and urinary troubles. The solution: Spay and neuter the cat, then assign a gender (the vet recommends male) and give it reconstructive surgery.

The cost: $1,500, which a friend is helping the family raise. Clarke-Murphy says it's worth it, because Mittens has been ""part of my family"" since October.

As Bustle and Cosmopolitan point out, while hermaphroditic cats are rare, gender-related operations in cats aren't as uncommon as you might imagine. Last year, Mother Nature Network reported that some male cats suffering from urinary problems get what's called a ""perineal urethrostomy,"" in which its male genitals are removed and the urethra's opening is shortened to create an opening similar to what a female cat would have.

Of course, the purpose of such procedures isn't to reassign gender but to ease health problems, but that doesn't stop some from seeing it as a sex change.

And as for a fellow hermaphrodite, last year a Liverpool cat with both male and female parts had surgery to become female. (Speaking of expensive and strange veterinary procedures, here are two stories about goldfish surgeries.)

1606,"(Reuters) - Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State in Syria are training members of the group to fly in three captured fighter jets, a group monitoring the war said on Friday, saying it was the first time the militant group had taken to the air.

The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria.

U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes.

""They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,"" Abdulrahman said.

""People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,"" he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border.

Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.

It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.

U.S. MILITARY KEEPING ""CLOSE EYE""

""We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,"" U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State.

""We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centres of gravity, wherever they may be.""

General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State.

""We don’t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don’t have any information on that either,"" he told a Pentagon news briefing.

Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats.

1611,"Days before Christmas, Internet prankster Josh Paler Lin set out to capture a simple social experiment on video. The YouTube star, better known for his sex in bathrooms and mafia gags, decided that he’d give a homeless man named Thomas $100 and then secretly follow him around to see how he’d spend the money.

Uploaded By: JoshPalerLin

The video, released on Monday, shows Thomas as he takes a stack of bills and walks right into a liquor store. But instead of booze, the homeless man walks out with a couple bags of food, heads over to a nearby park and starts giving it away to other people down on their luck. Moved by the selfless act, Lin then confronts Thomas and tells him that he’s being filmed.

“There’s things money can’t buy,” the homeless man says. “I get a happiness out of what I’m doing.”

With its surprising plot twist and selfless central character, Lin’s social experiment lit the Internet ablaze this week. By Saturday morning, the video had topped 24 million views and earned its creator international headlines. Meanwhile, the outpouring of support for Thomas became so great that Lin launched an Indiegogo fundraising campaign to “help Thomas get a fresh start.” It’s now netted more than $112,000.

But if 2014 taught us anything about viral social-experiment videos, it is that viewers should be skeptical of their creators until proven otherwise. In the last year alone, they have duped millions by staging videos of cops racially profiling Muslims, creepy dudes trying to take advantage of drunk girls and even a video of a heroic Syrian boy rescuing a girl amid a barrage of bullets. Keeping these hoaxes in mind, we reached out to Lin on Friday night.

By the time the interview was over, we were left with even more questions.

The YouTube prankster insists that he didn’t stage the video, and now has even bigger plans for the Internet’s latest folk hero. How Thomas feels about all of this remains unclear. After Lin’s video exploded on Monday, he says he plucked Thomas from the homeless shelter where he’d been staying and put him up in a hotel, the name of which Lin will not disclose. Lin also says he has kept Thomas from speaking to any media.

During his interview with Vocativ on Friday night, Lin declined multiple times to let us speak with Thomas, though he claimed he was with him. However, Lin insists that Thomas is being well cared for. Over the last few days, Lin has published a number of photos on his Facebook page showing Thomas eating dinner at different restaurants with Lin and his friends. He says he has purchased Thomas a cellphone so the two can stay in touch throughout the day. Lin also says he’s taken Thomas to get a haircut and shopping at Nordstrom to “clean him up.”

“Basically I’m trying to help him get his life back together,” Lin says.

All of Lin’s hard work will be revealed on Sunday, when he plans to release a new video about Thomas on his YouTube channel. “It’s going to be an extreme makeover,” Lin says.

Then, following Sunday’s big reveal, Lin says he has another media event in the works where he will surprise Thomas with all of the money that’s been raised for him on Indiegogo. Asked about the money raised on Indiegogo and how the public could be certain that all of it goes to Thomas, Lin says his lawyers, agent and manager have everything “covered.” When asked for the names of his lawyers, agent and manager, Lin refused to provide them, claiming they are “confidential.” He also declined to let any of them speak with Vocativ.

Lin bristled at the suggestion that any part of his original video had been staged or scripted. “Anyone who thinks that hasn’t ever met the kinds of people who are out there [on the street],” he says. “There is is no way we’re making this up. This is real. They don’t know Thomas. They don’t know his whole story.”"
1629,"A Russian fisherman says a Justin Bieber ringtone on his phone scared away a bear that was mauling him near his favorite fishing spot, according to video from Newsy.

Igor Vorozhbitsyn says a brown bear jumped on him and began mauling him before his mobile phone went on and began playing the Bieber tune Baby. The victim, who had already suffered severe cuts and bruises, said the bear ran off in fear once the tune began playing.

He was found by other fisherman, who used his phone to call for help, Newsy says.

Scientists explain that it wasn't necessarily a Bieber tune that scared off the bear off - it could have been any unexpected loud noise. However, the victim felt a need to explain why he had the Bieber song as a ringtone, telling news outlets that his granddaughter uploaded it as a joke."
1670,"Although the majority of Austrian resorts are suffering from a lack of snow there is one where it is business as usual – thanks to the fact that they stored snow from last year.

Resort managers in Saalbach-Hinterglemm in the state of Salzburg say their planned opening is going head as expected thanks to the fact that they saved up tons of snow from last year which they have now put back on the slopes.

Austria is one of the world's most popular skiing destinations and any delay in the usual season start at the beginning of December costs the industry millions.

But while most resorts in the Austrian Alps are currently struggling with an almost total lack of snow, including Flachau in Salzburg and Rosskopf mountain in Tyrol, at a time when the snow is usually plentiful, Saalbach-Hinterglemm has no such problems.

A recent Austrian climate report found the country’s temperatures had risen twice as fast as the global average since 1880, with the number of sunshine hours in the Alps increasing by 20 percent.

And although many resorts have shifted their focus to adaptation solutions, acknowledging that climate change will not be stopped or turned around any time soon, it is the ski resort at Saalbach-Hinterglemm that really planned ahead with the most success.

For the seventh year running the Snow Mobile event will be taking place in Saalbach-Hinterglemm as planned thanks to the snow that was carefully stored since March.

The resort management collected around 13,000-square-metres of snow from the mountains earlier in the year and then stored it by covering it with an artificial fleece and wood chips to keep it cool and prevent it from melting.

A spokesman for the resort said: ""We made sure the covering was airtight, and it paid off. We estimate we have lost about 15 percent of the snow that we put away which is pretty good going given that it's been such a warm year.""

The snow is currently being spread and flattened to allow the event at the weekend to go ahead as planned. Around 22,000 people are expected to turn up to watch."

This news shouldn't bring me so much joy, but Bleeding Cool rumormonger Rich Johnston is reporting that the Batmobile, or at least one of the Batmobiles used for filming Superman v. Batman: Paths of Glory, has been stolen. The movie is being filmed in Detroit, which hasn't been going through the best times of late. There's no official confirmation yet, but hey, maybe somebody needed it to drive out of town to get some fucking water.

Hey, their tax dollars paid for the breaks Warner Bros. gets for shooting in the state anyway, so when you look at it that way, the thieves were just taking back what was rightfully theirs!

But don't worry! The Outhouse has it on good authority that the theft wasn't at all malicious. It was just some people trying to win the prize in MTV's Steal the Batmobile contest from 1989!"
1678,"A secret government document has been leaked revealing the ""administrative order"", telling authorities to ensure no one else is named ""Kim Jong-un"".

And if people don't agree, then to ""train them"" to change it.

It is believed anyone with the same name would be forced to have official documents, identity cards and even school certificates altered.

And officials have been told to reject any birth certificates for the name.

The internal policy was obtained by South Korean news station KBS TV and highlights some of the leader's craziest rules.

His name game was said to have been set up by a directive shortly after cheese-loving Kim was made Supreme Leader.

And he will find you...UH-OH: And he will find you... [AP]
“We'll train them to voluntarily change their names.”
The document reads
The document reads: ""All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-Un... and train them to voluntarily change their names.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip … regarding this project.""

It is unsure whether the directive is authentic but officials have said that the names of each North Korean leader in the past - Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il - have been banned.

Yet North Korean defector Park Jin-hee, who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive was real.

“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-un.""

The news comes after accusations emerged that North Korean officials hacked Sony Pictures and leaked a number of future productions.

The North Korean have refused to comment on the cyber attack."

1694,"It is reported from Saudi Arabia that it has introduced a new law - which prohibits women from having the ""tempting eyes"". But the news is from 2011, and it seems not even sue.

""A new law in Saudi Arabia, forcing women to wear full veils, if their eyes are considered too 'tempting'. It reports the British Metro and refers to a krönikeliknande opinion text from the Assyrian news agency Aina. ""

So writes the Omni in a short news text published on Wednesday evening, and join the ranks thus to a wide range of international media and web pages in recent days reported the same news. Including British Metro , US news website Inquisitr and Serbian Telegraph .

They all use the article from the news agency Aina source. The article is published on October 30, and is - as Omni mention - written in, and colored by, a personal tone . But not only that: it is also written by the legendary musician Cole Porter, who is mentioned in the article, but died in 1964. At least according to the article's byline .

Old news - from 2011

Does this sound fishy? It's weird. In fact, namely, the full text of the news agency Ainas article copied outright, from a post on the site the Daily Beast - published on 19 November 2011.

Even then, in 2011, circulated the news of the Saudi law widely, and published, among other things, the British Daily Mail . The original source of the time seems to have been an article on the site bikyamasr.com. There are today a weird Russian blog titled ""Business World"", but through service Internet Archive can the old article from November 16, 2011 read. The text sets out no earlier source.

So it is a three year old news now circulating as new. This results in multiple abnormalities. Under the text ""Prince Naif supports the new law"" links such as Omni to an article published this week on the site firsttoknow.com, alleging that ""Prince Naif, the Saudi throne appears to be an equally cruel ruler like his father King Abdullah, has spoken out in full support for the new law. ""

But that claim is not particularly new, but comes from the publications that were made in 2011 - Prince Naif, or Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud as his real name was, namely, died in 2012.

""Religious police deny""

Abdulhadi Khalaf is a lecturer in Sociology at Lund University and expert on the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East, and he says he has not heard about this news myself. Later he emailed a link.

- It is evident that the ""religious police"" has denied that it has issued such a law, writes Khalaf.

The religious police who Khalaf refers to the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of cargo (CPVPV), the Saudi authorities who declare that Sharia law is followed. Basically all the articles written about the law, as well in 2014 as in 2011, citing a Motlab Sheikh al Nabet to be a spokesperson for CPVPV.

But Sheikh Motlab al Nabet exists nowhere on the web, in addition to the items on this particular law. And the link that Abdulhadi Khalaf find goes to an article that is published on the Saudi news website Hail News that Abdulhadi Khalaf says is credible ""information relating to the Saudi authorities.""

There CPVPV denies the story of the illegal tempting eyes. The article writes Hail News that ""the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of cargo say they are not issuing any statement which is consistent with yesterday's international spread accusations that they'd begun to crack down on women with glamorous eyes.""

Viral examiner fails to reach the Saudi Embassy in Stockholm, the Swedish embassy in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, claims not to have heard of the law.

1700,"My wrists and I have had a troubled relationship since last week.

Ever since Apple revealed its vast array of watches, my lower forearms have looked up at me and hissed: ""Well? You're going to leave us naked?""

So I spent some time yesterday browsing Apple's site and perusing all the different types of watches that will soon be available.

The fancier model -- the so-called Apple Watch Edition -- does look relatively lovely on tiny female forms. But how much might it cost? All Tim Cook offered last week was that the watches -- the cheapest presumably being the sporty ones you'll sweat all over -- will start at $349.

Then along comes influential Apple observer John Gruber to insert a little informed perspective.

""Apple Watch is not a product from a tech company, and it will not be understood, at all, by the tech world,"" he said.

This incites a kaleidoscope of optimism for those who find tech minds frightfully insular. For Gruber, the higher-end watches -- the Apple Watch made of stainless steel and the Watch Edition adorned with 18-karat gold -- will be competing directly with fancy watches.

What they will offer is a (hopefully) gorgeous watch with some fancy gizmos attached.

It's a persuasive concept, one that makes your standard Rolexy thing a klutzy lump of gold that can merely tell the time and make you look like something of a exhibitionist half-wit.

However, if you want your artistic creation to seem valuable, you have to price it as such. So Gruber wagers that the stainless steel Apple watch will start at around $999. The Edition, however, he places at $4,999.

In his words: ""I think Apple Watch prices are going to be shockingly high -- gasp-inducingly, get-me-to-the-fainting-couch high -- from the perspective of the tech industry. But at the same time, there is room for them to be disruptively low from the perspective of the traditional watch and jewelry world.""

The thing that's missing currently is the full gamut of what Apple's watches will be capable of doing. We've seen the basic hardware, but we don't know that much about the software.

Between now and their launch -- some time in 2015 -- Apple's team has time, surely, to develop and keep in secrecy all sorts of amusing functionality. This functionality will keep your first date enthralled for hours as you waft your Apple Watch before his or her mesmerized eyes.

Not only will you seem to be a person of means, but one who means to know where the world is at.

Even if the fanciest of its watches costs $4,999, Apple still has the problem of obsolescence and general pain-in-the-buttness.

Do you really want an extra item to charge every night? Do you really want to replace your watch every couple of years? Or might there, as Gruber suggests, be a nifty software-update solution so that you don't have to toss it in the drawer next to all your old iPhones?

What's most important here, though, is that Apple is proving ever more that what is conventionally called tech is not its main domain.

We humans are posers, as much if not more than we're thinkers. We sift the world through imagery, rather than substance. Somehow, substance is a more shifty essence than is our world of impressions.

Impressions are instant, substance takes time. There are too many demands on our time for us to bother to dig deep into the substance of everything (or even anything much at all). So we sift our world by looking at it and absorbing impressions.

MORE TECHNICALLY INCORRECT

Man demands iPhone 6 as dowry, report says
GoDaddy makes very funny ad (no, really)
Samsung hires Kristen Bell to help you forget about Apple
Apple's watches will exist first to make certain impressions. Buried a little deeper, however, will likely be a certain substance that is unique to these fashion accessories. This is what Apple means when it says these are the most ""personal"" devices it's ever made.

It's like any relationship. You're first moved by looks. Then you hope that there's something more behind them, something that will be the glue that creates a deeper, longer-lasting bond.

You might choose to pay $4,999 or even more for a gold Apple Watch Edition. But you'll need it to be more than just a pretty face. And that's where Apple hopes to make a killing."
1719,"Bah, humbug!

A passenger was tossed off a plane at La Guardia Airport on Tuesday after flipping out — because airline workers wished him a merry Christmas.

The man was waiting to board American Airlines Flight 1140 to Dallas when a cheerful gate agent began welcoming everyone with the Yuletide greeting while checking boarding passes.

The grumpy passenger, who appeared to be traveling alone, barked at the woman, “You shouldn’t say that because not everyone celebrates Christmas.”

The agent replied, “Well, what should I say then?”

“Don’t say, ‘Merry Christmas!’ ” the man shouted before brushing past her.

Once on the plane, he was warmly greeted by a flight attendant who also wished him a “merry Christmas.” That was the last straw.

“Don’t say, ‘Merry Christmas!’ ” the man raged before lecturing the attendants and the pilot about their faux pas.

The crew tried to calm the unidentified man, but he refused to back down and continued hectoring them.

He was escorted off the plane as other fliers burst into cheers and applause.

American Airlines did not return a request for comment."
1722,"Stories are coming out of Managua, Nicaragua, that a large bang was heard by residents there Saturday evening, and it registered on seismic detectors as well. A crater was found in the woods measuring something like 12 meters (40 feet) across. Claims are being made that this was a meteorite impact, a space rock a meter or so across slamming into the ground at high speed.

Phil Plait writes Slate’s Bad Astronomy blog and is an astronomer, public speaker, science evangelizer, and author of Death From the Skies!

… but I’m unconvinced. Reports are still a bit sketchy, but my biggest doubts come in two parts:

1) In a city of over two million people, you’d expect a fireball around midnight would’ve been seen by a lot of people. I haven’t heard any confirmed reports of witnesses. Also, I haven’t seen any video from it either. The situation in Chelyabinsk in 2013 was different, of course, but video of that event showed up with an hour or two. I’d expect that after two days we’d have some visual evidence from Managua by now.

Note: I’ve already seen a video on YouTube claiming to be from the fireball, but it’s not; it’s a bright meteor that came in over Spain. Don’t be fooled by hoaxes! There are always lots of them when something like this happens. The picture at the top of this post appears in a lot of hoaxes; it was from a fireball over the Netherlands in 2009.

b) No meteorite has yet been found. If this was an impact, there should be debris in the crater, at the very least on a microscopic scale. I haven’t heard of any analysis of the soil there to look for fragments, either.

I am not saying this was not a meteorite impact. I am saying the evidence for this that I’ve seen so far leaves me pretty unconvinced. I’ll note this happened near an Air Force base, too, which again makes me a little more suspicious.

So my skeptic sense is tingling here, and won’t be assuaged until we get much better evidence than has been reported so far. I’ll add that some places are reporting that this may have been connected with asteroid 2014 RC, which passed by the Earth on Sunday. Although this was a near miss (2014 RC got less than 40,000 km from Earth) I am very, very doubtful of a connection. The asteroid passed at 18:00 UTC Sunday, which was noon Nicaragua time: 12 hours or so after whatever happened in Managua. It’s incredibly unlikely that a small piece of that asteroid was that far ahead of the main mass and still managed to hit us. The asteroid was moving at 40,000 kilometers per hour, so it was still farther away than the Moon when this event occurred.

Bottom line: This may or may not have been an impact from a meteorite. At the moment, based on what I’ve seen so far, I’d bet against it… but I’ve been wrong before. Until I see confirmed video or actual confirmed meteorite fragments I’ll remain doubtful."
1752,"Macaulay Culkin has been killed off again – in yet another internet hoax.

Back in April rumours surfaced that the troubled star had been found dead. Just seven months later it’s gone and happened again.

Some not funny dudes thought it would be really funny to set up a Facebook page reportedly called Rip Macaulay Culkin and post a message claiming the star had died. He hasn’t, by the way.

Oh LOL.

The group gained thousands of likes and although has since been removed, the news is still doing the rounds on social networks.

The original post is alleged to have said:

‘At about 11 a.m. ET on Thursday (November 06, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away. Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.’

Reports said that he’d been found dead in his Manhattan appartment.

In truth, he’s alive and well and probably not particularly amused that some hoaxer is claiming he’s anything but.

The doctor who reportedly took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was under anesthesia has denied she ever took the photo, according to reports.

The woman, who has been identified as Dr. Gwen Korovin according to TMZ , refused to comment when photographers spotted her heading to work in New York a matter of hours ago - but friends now insist it's ""lies"".

According to TMZ, Dr Korovin also told friends she never performed a biopsy, as has been claimed, and added CNN's source - who originally broke the story about the selfie - is ""making up lies"".

But sources were unable to say if the doctor performed any other procedure.

It comes shortly after she was spotted rushing past photographers today, refusing to comment when asked about the claims (see video below).

Dr Korovin wouldn't look at the camera when she was asked to comment in New York, and walked straight inside despite photographers shouting questions about the procedure and alleged selfie.

Arriving at work with a companion to protect her from cameras, the doctor hid behind huge sunglasses as she was ushered inside.

It’s thought Dr Gwen, who is an ear, nose and throat doctor to the stars, was working as Joan’s personal doctor when she attended the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 to undergo a routine procedure.

Mirror Celeb have contacted for comment.

On Wednesday it was claimed that the doctor, now believed to be Gwen, took a selfie with the star while she was under anaesthesia.

The incident allegedly occurred in Manhattan's Yorkville ­Endoscopy shortly before Joan, 81, underwent a procedure on her vocal chords that could have led to her suffering a cardiac arrest, CNN reports.

The clinic have made it very clear that they did not perform the alleged biopsy or put the comedienne under anaesthesia.

Following Joan’s death Dr. Lawrence - who is a world renowned gastroenterologist and co-owner of the clinic – resigned from his position.

And it seems it’s not her first time in the limelight – she previously appeared in a Celine Dion documentary.

The doctor, whose offices are on East 77th Street, New York, has previously worked with Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and Hugh Jackman.

Her office walls are believed to be lined with pictures of the famous people she has looked after over the years.

The Islamic State militant known as Jihadi John has been named today as Mohammed Emwazi.

The Washington Post and the BBC both named Emwazi as the Londoner seen in a series of horrific beheading videos.

They report that he was known to the security services but they had chosen not to disclose his name for 'operational reasons'.

The Washington Post said Emwazi, a former Westminster University student from west London, was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined IS.

Scotland Yard today refused to confirm the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

Jihadi John has appeared in a number of shocking videos where he is thought to have beheaded a number of western hostages.

Among those were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning.

Emwazi, who was given the nickname Jihadi John after freed hostages revealed he and other British ISIS members were 'jokingly' likened to the Beatles, first appeared in a video last August, when he appeared to kill the American journalist James Foley.

In dark red brick small block. Neighbours genuinely shocked at this morning's revelation.— Andy Lines (@andylines) February 26, 2015     12:20 pm   Reign of terror The man known as Jihadi John has appeared in a series of sickening videos showing the brutal murder of innocent men.He first came to light in August last year when a gruesome video was posted online showing him holding US hostage James Foley.The video then cut away, before then focusing on the journalist's decapitated body.It was the first in a number of shocking videos that later included two British men, David Haines and Alan Henning, two further American's and two Japanese men.         12:10 pm   PM 'concerned' about name Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi's name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ""The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.""There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.""   Getty         12:06 pm   Radicalisation study group: ""Name is correct"" A statement from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London said: ""We believe that the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.""'Jihadi John' is not special, in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.""The fact that 'Jihadi John' has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one's identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.""This demonstrates what we have long said about radicalisation, that it is not something driven by poverty or social deprivation. Ideology clearly plays a big role in motivating some men to participate in jihadist causes.""British fighters have clearly demonstrated that they are not in this conflict to take a back seat. They are full participants in this war, operating as suicide-bombers, hostage-takers, and executioners.""         12:04 pm   Name 'confirmed' by US sources The American news network ABC has reported that it has had the 'true' identity of Jihadi John confirmed.The network reports: ""A former senior U.S. intelligence official who was involved in the hunt for the man confirmed the name to ABC News.""     12:00 pm   Beatles nickname Emwazi was given the nickname John by hostages owing to the fact that he and other British terrorists were holding them hostage.While he was John, another was called George.Although born in Kuwait, Emwazi reportedly grew up in a decent neighbourhood in west London - where he also went to university.It has been reported that he also occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich, south London.     11:56 am   Jihadi John first appeared in shocking video The man known as Jihadi John rose to notoriety when he first appeared in a video posted online in August, in which he appeared to kill the American journalist James Foley.Dressed in all black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, he reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and American aid worker Peter Kassig, as well as footage of Mr Henning's death.And last month, the militant appeared in a video with the Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.   Nicole Tung   Murdered: James Foley        11:53 am   Emwazi 'expressed sympathy with terrorist' The Washington Post reports that Emwazi was upset when an al-Qaeda terrorist was convicted for the attempted murder of US nationals in Afghanistan.The American-trained neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui has become a cause celebre in the Muslim world after she was jailed for 86 years for a shooting which took place while she was being questioned as an al Qaida suspect in Afghanistan in 2008.Following her conviction, Emwazi is alleged to have written that he had: ""heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!!""Last year, ISIS called for the release of Siddiqui as a condition for sparing the life of US journalist James Foley.   Terrorist: Aafia Siddiqui        11:46 am   'Stopped by British authorities' It was shortly after this that Emwazi reportedly moved back to his birthplace of Kuwait.He had got a job working for a computer company but he still returned to London on two further occasions.The second time was to finalise wedding plans he had put in place for his girlfriend in Kuwait.According to Mr Quershi, he was stopped by counter-terror officers in the UK, who held him, took his fingerprints.It is claimed he was also stopped from flying back to Kuwait the following day, while intelligence officers investigated him further.In a frustrated email to Mr Quershi at the time in June 2010 he allegedly wrote: ""I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started.""I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace and country, Kuwait.         11:40 am   'MI5 tried to recruit him' British security are reported to have tried to recruit Emwazi after he was stopped when he flew into Amsterdam.It is alleged that the young Londoner was accused of trying to reach Somalia, the 'headquarters' of terror group al-Shabab, but Emwazi refuted this and then told a pal how MI5 officers tried to recruit him.     11:36 am   'Radicalised in Tanzania' It is being reported that Emwazi started being radicalised after travelling to Tanzania for a safari following his graduation from the University of Westminster.The Washington Post reports that the Londoner, who is said to be his 20s, and a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man called Abu Talib became frustrated after they were held by police once they landed.The trio were held overnight in May 2009 and eventually deported.     11:31 am   Resemblance is ""extremely strong"" A representative of the British human rights group CAGE also spoke to the Washington Post and backed up the claims that Emwazi was the terrorist known as Jihadi John.The group is reported to have been in contact with Emwazi before he left for SyriaAsim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, said: ""There was an extremely strong resemblance.""This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.”     11:25 am   Pal: 'He was like a brother to me' According to the Washington Post, Emwazi grew up in west London and graduated from university there with a degree in computer programming.It is being reported that he comes from a ""well-to-do"" family, some of who are believed to still live in the area, but that he travelled to Syria in 2012 - later joining the Islamic State.One of his friends, who asked not to be identified, said: ""I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John. He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.”      11:20 am   Police 'not confirming' Police have declined to comment on the reports that Jihadi John has been named.Commander Richard Walton of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command said: ""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""         11:18 am   West Londoner The true identity of the masked terrorist who has appeared in a series of shocking Islamic State videos has been revealed as Mohammed Emwazi.The west Londoner was said to have already been known by security forces in the UK before he gained infamy around the world.According to reports, his real name was not revealed for some time due to 'operational reasons'.Emwazi, who was given the name Jihadi John by some of his hostages, has appeared in a number of shocking videos where he is thought to have beheaded a number of western hostages.Among those were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning.     //<![CDATA[ var randomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*11); $LAB.queueScript(""http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"") .queueScript(""http:\/\/s.mirror.co.uk\/resources\/js/tm.livenow.js?v="" + randomNumber) .queueWait(function(){ $(""#live-now-5235081"").liveNow({ ""ajaxSrc"" : ""http:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/news\/uk-news\/article5235081.ece?service=ajax&profileIconCrop=s40&item=liveNow&entryId="", ""interval"" : ""10000"", ""liveNowId"" : ""5235081"", ""latestEntryId"" : ""5235722"", ""lowestEntryId"" : ""5235114"", ""generateEntriesOnClientLiveNowClosed"" : """", ""numberOfLiveNowUpdatesId"" : """", ""showNumberOfLiveNowUpdatesId"" : """", ""resetLiveNowEntriesCounterId"" : """", ""reverseNewEntries"" : false }); }); //]]>"
1816,"A real-life zombie cat truly exists! A buried cat clawed his way out of his grave after being left for dead alongside a road in Florida. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay has taken in the miracle cat and hopes to do their best to help save him.

Rescuers tell FOX 13 in Tampa Bay that the miracle kitty has severe trauma to his head, has a dead eye, a broken jaw, and other serious injuries.

Ellis Hutson is the cat’s owner and says “Bart” was hit by a vehicle and left for dead. He buried his beloved cat several days ago and is amazed Bart survived his horrendous ordeal.

Bart wound up on a neighbor’s front yard after he dug himself out of the grave. Hutson told rescuers that he was certain he was dead. He has no way of explaining how the buried cat clawed his way out of his grave. When they found the zombie cat alive, he was rushed to the veterinarian hospital.

Bart will have an operation, but will lose one eye.

“This doesn’t happen. Cats don’t just come back to life. Not five days after they’ve been put in the ground,” Hutson’s neighbor said, according to News 96.5.

Doctors at the Humane Society of Tampa Bay are scheduling surgery to save Bart’s life. There’s no guarantee he’ll make it, but his good luck after fooling everyone into thinking he was dead may be an indicator as to how well he pulls through again!

FOX 13 reports that rescuers tell them they believe Bart may have regained consciousness, dug himself out of the ground, and decided to hide out for a few days. They believe Bart will live, but will lose one of his eyes.

Bart is still in good spirits despite being hit by a car then buried alive. He purrs when he gets attention, loves being pet, and acts as though nothing happened. The black-and-white cat is very much a big mess – covered in dirt and dried up blood. When he gets all fixed up again, he should be good to go.

The Inquisitr wrote on another animal that was believed dead, but dug itself out of a grave. A hamster was buried in the ground and 24 hours later managed to crawl out.

The story about a buried cat clawing his way out of his grave is good news for his owner who hated parting with his pet. It’s yet one more story of a cat having nine lives!

1819,"A holidaymaker was left horrified after discovering a tropical spider had burrowed underneath his skin during a trip to Bali.

Dylan Thomas was abroad with friends when he discovered the strange red trail stretching two inches across his stomach.

The 21-year-old Australian was told by doctors at the Bali International Medical Centre that he was suffering from an allergic reaction to an insect bite and was sent away with some antihistamine cream.

But three days later, when the red mark began to blister, and almost double in length, Mr Thomas knew there was something wrong.

After going back to the medical centre to see a dermatologist, health professionals were shocked to discover that a tropical spider was burrowing just below the surface of his skin.

Doctors managed to extract the spider from Mr Thomas' abdomen and revealed that the insect had buried itself into the scar from his recent appendix removal."

1837,"It seems like robots are everywhere these days, and now they’re rolling around Microsofts Silicon Valley campus R2-D2-style to fight crime and keep everyone safe. At least that’s the idea behind a pilot program the company ran last week to test a fleet of five K5 security guard robots.

Designed and manufactured by robotics company Knightscope, K5s weigh 300 pounds and are 5 feet tall. They use cameras and sensors to keep track of their surroundings and look for suspcious activity. They can “see” license plate numbers and even analyze faces. While K5s aren’t equipped with weapons (and can’t run or get in someone’s face anyway), they do have onboard alarms and sirens to alert people if something bad is going on. And if they spot something that a person should handle, they can call a human security guard over. The K5s also use laser scanning and GPS for navigating, weather sensors, and, of course, Wi-Fi connectivity.

Stacy Stephens, Knightscope’s co-founder and vice president of sales and marketing, told MIT Tech Review, “This takes away the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work, and leaves the strategic work to law enforcement or private security, depending on the application.”

K5s are mostly meant for spotting strange or unusual behavior, but if you’re in trouble you can also use them to call for help. They have battery life of about 24 hours and can automatically bring themselves back to their charging stations when they’re low on juice. And it’s true that there’s artificial intelligence coordinating an A5’s actions and making decisions about where it should go and what it should do next. But reaction to the robots seems kind of alarmist.

ExtremeTech writes that by testing the robots, Microsoft is “[s]howing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization.” That and other comments might be meant as tongue-in-cheek, but the A5s don’t seem any different from the robot guards South Korea piloted in prisons in 2012 or even Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot, which is designed to be used in dangerous situations like natural disaster relief or fire rescues.

If they were armed, A5s might seem scarier, but as eyes and ears that never get tired and can just endlessly putter around a big campus, A5s seem like a reasonable solution."
1841,"After early discussions to play the Apple founder, Christian Bale has decided to part ways with the Steve Jobs biopic at Sony.

While negotiations were never fully under way, sources tell Variety that Bale had talks with director Danny Boyle about taking on the role, but a deal never came to fruition. The news comes almost two weeks after the biopic’s screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, told Bloomberg that Bale was a lock for the part of Jobs. ““We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that’s Chris Bale,” he said. “It’s an extremely difficult part and he’s gonna crush it.”

Sony will now look to find its replacement after Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio both passed on the part. The studio is in discussions with Seth Rogen to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

Scott Rudin, Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady are producing.

Bale is in negotiations to play Travis McGee in Fox’s “The Deep Blue Goodbye” and can be seen next in Fox’s “Exodus: Gods and Kings.” He is repped by WME."
1851,"Although Joan Rivers went to Yorkville Endoscopy for a routine procedure, her time spent there was anything but routine.

As RadarOnline.com has previously reported, Rivers’ female ear, nose and throat doctor stepped in once Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Rivers’ gastroenterologist, discovered something on her vocal cords. The ENT, who wasn’t authorized to perform any medical procedures at the clinic, took over and began a biopsy.

The biopsy was not authorized, as Rivers never signed a consent form. And once it began, her vocal cords began to swell, Anderson 360 revealed Tuesday night. But that’s not all. Not only was the ENT not supposed to be treating the comedienne, 81, at this time, medical staffers have also told investigators that the ENT snapped a selfie with the Fashion Police star while she was under anesthesia – a major violation of privacy, given she did not give her consent to have her picture taken.

Dr. Cohen, who doubled as the clinic’s medical director, has since parted ways with Yorkville. The clinic confirmed his departure, stating, Dr. Cohen “is not currently performing procedures…nor is he currently serving as medical director.”

1853,"A dog was found abandoned at a Scottish train station next to a suitcase filled with it's belongings and now the local animal welfare charity are looking for tips into who is the neglectful owner.

The dog, a male shar-pei named Kai, was found sitting with a leash attached to a banister at the Ayr railway station on Jan. 2, according to the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

""Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature,"" Scottish SPCA Inspector Stewart Taylor said in the group's release.

Amazing Animals From Around the World
The group reported that the suitcase contained a dog bowl, food, a pillow and toy -- although that doesn't clear the owner from wrongdoing.

Abandoning an animal is an offense in Scotland and, if they are able to determine who left the dog in the station, that person or persons could be banned from owning animals for life.

""Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible,"" Taylor said.

Officials were able to determine the dog's name because the animal had been microchipped by a previous owner. When they contacted that individual, he reported that he had sold the dog in 2013 but did not have any information on the new owner.

Taylor said that the group will care for the dog until they find an owner for Kai."

1891,"THERE are unconfirmed reports that jihadists fighting for the Islamic State have contracted Ebola.

Local media outlets reported that cases of Ebola have showed up at a hospital in the IS-controlled city of Mosul, in Iraq, Mashable reported.

Iraq’s official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, claimed that the disease had arrived in Mosul from jihadists “from several countries” including Africa.

An official told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants’ symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus. Although the symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, can easily be mistaken for many other illnesses such as malaria.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has been unable to confirm the cases.

Christy Feig, WHO’s director of communications told Mashable they were in the process of reaching out to government officials in Iraq to see if help was needed investigating the cases.

IS counts fighters from a number of African countries among its ranks though few, if any, are known to have come from areas hit by Ebola."
1896,"Boko Haram has reportedly agreed to a cease-fire with the Nigerian military as well as the release of hundreds of schoolgirls who were abducted by the terrorist group earlier this year, officials said Friday. The jihadist militia has not yet made a public statement about the decision, which could confirm the arrangement, according to the BBC.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told the BBC. ""I am cautiously optimistic."" The announcement of the release and cease-fire comes after a month of negotiations between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram, which has killed more than 2,000 civilians in 2014 alone.

The little-known al Qaeda offshoot gained national attention in April when they abducted some 300 schoolgirls from a school in Chibok, northern Nigeria, to be sold as slaves. The abduction sparked international outrage and the social media campaign #BringBackOurGirls that enlisted the likes of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and countless celebrities. Human rights organizations are watching the ongoing deals closely for any developments.

We are monitoring the news with huge expectations http://t.co/L01FrUFKwz #BringBackOurGirls

— #BringBackOurGirls (@BBOG_Nigeria) October 17, 2014

In August, Boko Haram declared an “Islamic state” in northeastern Nigeria, the Washington Post reported. Authorities believe the group is hiding the girls somewhere in that area. Jennifer Cook, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the longer the girls stay in captivity, the harder it would be to bring them home.

“With hostage situations with this many people, to bring one set back without endangering another set is very difficult,” Cooke told Time. “In some cases, there’s a pretty good idea of where they are, but extricating them from a group of armed criminals who have so little respect for life is a difficult negotiation process. And the longer they’re there, the greater likelihood they become dispersed, and the more difficult they are to track down.”

It's unclear how the girls have been treated during their captivity, raising questions about their health. “These girls are being held under absolutely horrific circumstances, subjected to sexual violence and rape, forced into servitude,” Cooke said. “There are reports that some have become pregnant.”"
1910,"One tactic that should prevent overly hormonal street-bros from catcalling women is imagining what their own mothers would think of this behavior. In a new Peruvian ad, however, that threat becomes an all-too-real Freudian nightmare.


Athletics brand Everlast recently teamed up with activist group Paremos el Acoso Callejero (Stop Street Harassment) to teach catcallers on the streets of Lima what their mothers apparently never taught them--by using the people in the world most suited for that very task. In the viral video, which is clearly staged, although it's fun to pretend that it isn't, the Paremos team gets hold of the mothers of area serial harassers and recruits them for a guerrilla mission to end their sons' lives.


These women disguise themselves with dresses, wigs and a copious amount of makeup to go undercover as catcall-bait--and it works to a degree that will alternately delight and horrify. It's probably the funniest possible way to call attention to the fact that 7 out of 10 women on the streets of Peru are sexually assaulted. This dumb video may not be real, but the problem is, and it's a good way to remind potential catcallers of the inherent grossness of their actions."
1911,"In the days leading up to Apple's big event next week, which is rumored to be focused on the Apple Watch, a new detail about the company's first wearable has been leaked.  Along with all other features mentioned during Tim Cook's unveiling of the smartwatch in September, the device will also come with a feature called Power Reserve, according to The New York Times.

The report, which cites an anonymous Apple employee, claims that the unannounced feature will allow the watch operate in a mode that only shows the current time on its display, presumably to preserve battery power for other functions.

A standby mode for a wearable isn't particularly innovative, but given the questions surrounding the battery life of the Apple Watch (about a day, according to Apple), a Power Reserve feature dedicated to preserving battery life could be the device's saving grace. (Particularly when figures like $5,000 are being tossed around the rumor mill as the price for the top tier model.)

Another surprising detail revealed in the report is that during field testing of the Apple Watch, engineers disguised the device with a fake casing to make it look like a Samsung smartwatch. So if you've seen Apple employees walking around with what looks like a Samsung Gear and wondered why, you now have an answer to the mystery.

That last detail will probably come as a surprise to Samsung, a company often accused of following Apple's lead when it comes to mobile devices. But it also highlights the fact that Apple is entering a space already packed with smartwatches, so the success of the Apple Watch isn't a foregone conclusion, solid battery life or not.

1917,"Apple originally planned for the Apple Watch to have a whole range of exciting health-tracking features, but the company had to cut many of them before its anticipated release this April, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The Apple Watch was meant to feature a system to track how stressed you are by measuring the conductivity of skin. You sweat more if you're nervous, and that makes your skin more conductive.

The Watch also included an electrocardiogram feature that measures a user's heart rate (that's more in-depth than simply measuring a pulse). But Apple couldn't get the health-tracking features to work in the way it wanted. It found that people with hairy arms or dry skin had trouble using the health monitors. And the watch didn't work properly on people who wore it too loosely around their wrist.

Other features that didn't make it into the final Apple Watch were blood-pressure and blood-oxygen-level tracking, according to The Journal. Those would have been tricky for Apple to include because providing medical advice or guidance from that data comes under the regulation of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in the US. We do know, however, that Apple secretly met with the FDA in 2013 to find out which features would come under the agency's regulation.

Apple was forced to cut the advanced health-tracking features from the Apple Watch because it simply couldn't get them to work. That doesn't mean that it isn't going to add them back in future versions of the device, though.

Elsewhere in its article, The Journal says the Apple Watch was known at Apple by the name ""black hole"" because it kept drawing in more and more resources. Development of the device reportedly took over four years."
1922,"Updated Dec. 31, 2014 11:30 a.m. EST.

This video proves that a person's integrity goes far beyond what meets the eye.

In a video uploaded to YouTube, prankster Josh Paler Lin gives $100 to a homeless man and secretly follows the him to find out how it's spent.

The homeless man is seen on camera buying food and giving it to strangers in the park. The sight turns Lin's perception of homelessness on its head.

Lin says he is ""stunned"" and admits he thought the man might buy alcohol.

""You just touched my heart,"" Lin told him.

While the gesture left the prankster so emotional that he decided to donate another $100, he also had something to offer Lin:

""There's a lot of people that are just victims of circumstance,"" the homeless man told him. ""And they didn't go homeless because they're lazy ...It could be a divorce, and one thing leads to another. A man sells his boat, his home, and all of a sudden he finds out he has no money. There's a lot of good people that are homeless.""

Update: Taugan Tan Kadalim, a passerby to the scene, told Vocativ that he witnessed some of the filming of the video and that the incident appeared to be staged. Kadalim told the site that Lin and the homeless man arrived at the liquor store in the same car. In response, Lin told HuffPost that Vocativ's allegation is ""false.""

1937,"Despite a wild report on a website dedicated to conspiracy theories, local soldiers haven't lost a low-yield nuclear weapon.

As the lockdown of soldiers in a Fort Carson battalion dragged into its fifth day Monday, the site Whatdoesitmean.com reported that a nuclear artillery shell was missing - an item that hasn't been in the Army inventory for 22 years. That story was translated into several languages, including Russian and spread rapidly on the Internet.

Photo - The modified M9-Beretta pistol used for the Basic Active Shooter Course fires a powder propelled paint cup to provide the most realistic training possible while maintaining the level of safety required for the scenarios, Jan 26.  The course is taught by a 4-man training team from the 610th Security Forces Squadron, Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas.  They came to Dobbins Air Reserve Base to provide this critical training for the 94th Security Forces Squadron and other Dobbins area security personnel.  The two day course provides classroom and tactical instruction to first responders covering several shooting spree scenarios.   (U.S. Air Force photo/ Brad Fallin) + caption

Sources at the post told The Gazette that the lockdown involving 100 soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armor Regiment is actually for something more mundane - a 9 mm pistol. The Army hasn't officially released details on what spurred the lockdown and search, calling it ""missing government property.""

The lockdown started with about 800 soldiers confined to the battalion's buildings on the post. That was reduced over the weekend to about 100 soldiers - a company of troops.

Retired Command Sgt. Maj. Terrance McWilliams, who served as the post's top enlisted soldier, said lockdowns are a common practice commanders use to turn up lost gear.

""I personally went through it as a 1st sergeant and the longest it took was four days,"" said McWilliams.

The lockdown was triggered Thursday after the pistol turned up missing in an equipment inventory that followed a training exercise. Post officials ordered a wide search for the missing weapon Thursday, including inspecting cars as they exited the post at gates.

Retired Command Sgt. Maj. John Kurak, who also held Fort Carson's top enlisted post, said a five-day lockdown isn't close to a record for Fort Carson.

""In Fort Carson's history there have been lockdowns that have lasted months,"" Kurak said, noting that an infantry battalion on there spent three months on lockdown in the late 1980s after a M-16 rifle was lost.

McWilliams said the first step in the search for the weapon likely was quizzing the soldier who checked it out from the unit's armory for the training exercise. The battalion's soldiers were returning from a training exercise that spanned a wide swath of the 137,000-acre post.

When it was determined that the weapon was lost, soldiers were likely sent to scouring training areas in a move called ""hands across Fort Carson"" that sees soldiers walking shoulder-to-shoulder to find the missing weapon.

When that didn't bear fruit, soldiers were ordered to remain on duty and on post until the weapon was found - a lockdown.

Long lockdowns like the one that deprived 1st Battalion soldiers of what was a planned four-day weekend, do come to an end.

""Eventually its going to get to the point where they determine the item is actually lost,"" McWilliams said. ""Then they will determine what actions to take against the person responsible for the item.""

Losing a weapon can bring stiff consequences in the military, where loss or destruction of government property can be charged as a crime bringing up to a year behind bars.

The Army spends a lot of time keeping track of pistols, rifles and other ""sensitive"" items. Every training day begins and ends with a sensitive items check, and daily inventories are sent up through the chain of command.

""If you can't keep track of your equipment, how can you be expected to do more complex tasks?"" Kurak asked.

In combat, units heading out and returning from stop for a ""boys and toys"" check to make sure all weapons, night vision goggles, laser sights, radios and other items are on hand.

""Accountability of equipment is a basic and essential function of a unit,"" Kurak said.

While the battalion may have lost a pistol, scores of web pages carried the nuclear weapon tale Monday. That story, attributed to unnamed Russian intelligence sources, alleged that a 155 mm artillery-fired nuclear warhead is missing at the post.

The battalion involved, though, doesn't have artillery. And the W-48 artillery warhead alleged to be missing was pulled from Army bases worldwide in 1992.

While the Pikes Peak region is home to a five military bases, it doesn't house nuclear weapons. The closest nuclear arms are atop Air Force intercontinental ballistic missiles at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyo."
1940,"A hoax report filed by website nationalreport.net claimed the infamous artist had been arrested in London during a raid on his art studio.

The website – which describes itself as ""America's No.1 independent news source"" – said a man named Paul Horner from Liverpool had been nicked.

They even had the cheek to say both the BBC and a representative for Bansky had confirmed the news.

To complete the tale they quoted ""London police chief"" Lyndon Edwards who apparently held a press conference to announce the arrest. A press conference apparently attended by no reporters or TV crews.

HOAX: The false report claiming Banksy had been arrested [NATIONALREPORT]
Most hilariously of all the article was written by one Darius Rubics who has ""won numerous awards for journalism including a Peabody Award and a Pulitzer Prize"".

Despite the ludicrous nature of the article some fell for it hook, line and sinker.

Former Tory MP Louise Mensch, never shy of sharing her opinion with the world, said: ""You have to be kidding me, @metpoliceuk. Banksy?

""There are so many criminals out there, Banksy? The great artist?""

She did later apologise after being duped.


There are so many problems with the hoax we've decided to list some of the best ones for you.

– The article claims Banksy is from Liverpool when all known evidence strongly suggests he is from Bristol.

– Other articles by Darius Rubics include: Dennis Rodman leaves US to talk with leaders of ISIS and Obama declares November national Muslim appreciation month.

– London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards doesn't exist. The top cop in London is Sir Bernard Hogan Howe.

– The article suggests Banksy was nicked in Watford which actually falls under the catchment of the Hertfordshire Police.

– In Britain police do not release mugshots of people after they have been arrested.

– Banksy's PR Jo Brooks, despite apparently being quoted in the original story, has tweeted saying it is a hoax."
1949,"There it was in the middle of a field, baking in the sun: a cache of grenades, rockets and guns. The trove was attached to a big black parachute and, as the camera focused in on the shipment, it seemed for a moment abandoned. Then you see the masked man, who sermonized for the occasion. An American airdrop of arms, he said, which had been intended for Kurdish fighters defending the city of Kobane, had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State.

“These are some of the American aid [items] that were dropped for the atheists in the” Kurdistan Workers’ Party,” the militant said in a video uploaded to jihadist social media accounts and initially reported by SITE Intelligence Group. “Ammunition, military equipment, additional equipment — these are some of the military weapons. The American forces dropped [them] … Praise be to Allah. Spoils for the mujahideen.”

News of the accidental airdrop, which the Associated Press corroborated and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed, brought fresh criticism to a military tactic — the air drop — officials said has become substantially more accurate in the past few decades, but is still evidently prone to screw-ups. And those screw-ups have popped up several times so far in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, underscoring the dangers of trusting the winds to carry valuable resources to their targets.

In early August, the U.S. military dropped more than 7,000 gallons of water and 36,000 packaged meals onto a barren mountain near Sinjar, the hiding spot for nearly 40,000 Yazidis who fled the Islamic State under threat of genocide. Many packages reached their intended targets — the Department of Defense estimated 80 percent — but not all of them did. “Iraqi officials said that much of the U.S. aid had been ‘useless’ because it was dropped from 15,000 feet without parachutes and exploded on impact,” wrote journalist Jonathan Krohn, who claimed to be the first Western journalist on the scene. The Washington Post’s Liz Sly agreed, saying the drops “apparently went awry.”

Then NBC News reported late last month Iraqi military pilots accidentally dropped food, water and weapons to Islamic State fighters instead of to their own soldiers, who were battling to retain control of Anbar province. “Some pilots, instead of dropping these supplies over the area of the Iraqi army, threw it over an area that is controlled by ISIS fighters,” Hakim al-Zamili said, using another name for the Islamic State. “Those soldiers were in deadly need of these supplies, but because of the wrong plans of the commanders in the Iraqi army and lack of experience of the pilots, we in a way or another helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers.”

Another general sheepishly added: “Yes, that’s what had happened.”

The embarrassing anecdotes feed into the complicated history of the airdrop, which still carries risks despite being honed over decades with technological advancements such as GPS-guided parachutes. “There’s no way you can predict who may end up with those weapons, and who is going to use them, or how they are going to use them,” Greg Myre of the Middle East Institute told the Daily Sabah. “That is one of the risks you have to take.”

It was a risk Bill Clinton was willing to take in 1993. That was the year he ordered an airdrop of tens of thousands of humanitarian packages over eastern Bosnia, despite the “military consistently arguing against involving U.S. troops in airdrops in hostile zones, given the fact that the accuracy of the drops is questionable,” the Associated Press then reported. The brass turned out to be right.

One major problem laid bare during that mission, military scientists later said, was what they called “wind drift.” “The problem was identified in the late ’90s,” John McGinley, a scientist who researched the topic, told The Washington Post’s Holly Watt in 2008. “The terrain in Bosnia meant that instead of landing in one valley, the cargo could drift into another valley that was held by the enemy. Wind drift was causing all the problems.”

So research teams got to work, ultimately unveiling wind-forecast software that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said increased the drop’s accuracy by 70 percent. “Inaccurate wind forecasts are the main culprit in missed targets for dropping supplies and other items from high altitudes,” the report said.

It almost immediately went into use in the war in Afghanistan, where far-flung military outposts were separated by stretches of roads pockmarked with insurgents and explosives. There had to be another way to get soldiers the equipment they needed, military officials thought, so they launched a massive increase in airdrops. “We’ve gotten a lot more accurate over the years,” Air Force Gen. Arthur Lichte told USA Today.

That may true. But following this week’s alleged delivery to the Islamic State, there’s clearly still room for work."

The baby of gigantic size surprised doctors and staff members who were not fully prepared for such an event but miraculously managed to give birth to the 40-pound (18 kilos) baby who remains in a healthy state, has confirmed a hospital spokesman.

The single mother who’s delivery necessitated a surgical incision in the mother’s abdomen and uterus was done to prevent any harm to the baby and mother’s health and was undergone without any complications.

However, these Indian lynch mobs took laws into their own hands after they caught 40-year-old Suresh Kumar trying to rape a girl in a dark area in Ganganagar city of India.

He was severely beaten by lynch mobs who heard the girl's scream for help as Suresh attacked her.

After he was mercilessly beaten, Suresh was dragged to a nearby butcher's shop and a meat cleaver was used to chop of his manhood.

2017,"Actor Christian Bale is in talks to play the leading role in the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic being produced by Sony, reports Variety. Leonardo DiCaprio was originally in talks to play Jobs, but withdrew from negotiations earlier this month.

Penned by Aaron Sorkin, the Steve Jobs biopic was originally set to be directed by ""The Social Network"" director David Fincher, who was said to be in talks with Sony earlier this year, but the director title went to Danny Boyle instead, who also directed the hit movie ""Slumdog Millionaire.""

When David Fincher was still attached to the project, he reportedly was hoping to cast Christian Bale in the lead role due to his undeniable resemblance to the former CEO. Christian Bale is also known for his ability to adapt to roles, shedding and gaining weight as necessary to accurately portray characters.

Ashton Kutcher famously starred as Steve Jobs in the ""JOBS"" movie that focused on the former Apple CEO's younger years, but the Sony film will be quite different, using material from Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography. The film, which has yet to receive a release date, will focus on three separate 30-minute scenes depicting three of Apple's product launches."
2022,"A newspaper report that Kim Jong-un has been hospitalized for ankle surgery has fuelled new theories about the North Korean leader’s long absence from the public eye.

Kim has not been seen in public in almost a month and missed a session of parliament on Sept. 25 for the first time since coming to power almost three years ago. Since an event with key officials in July, he has been seen walking with a limp. In an unusual acknowledgment last Friday, North Korean state television said he was experiencing “discomfort.”

Details from the Hermit Kingdom on Kim’s state of health are scarce and hard to verify, but the new details reported by the Chosun Ilbo newspaper paint a broader picture of what may have happened to him. Here is what is suspected so far.

Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, photos released by state media show. He is shown below in photos released by the Korean Central News Agency on Oct. 9, 2010, at left, and July 28, 2014, at right:

Kim is believed to be between 5-foot-2 and 5-foot-9, possibly weighing 280 pounds. Chosun Ilbo cited a recent visitor to North Korea (whom it did not identify) as saying that Kim’s weight gain, combined with an intense tour schedule of factories and military bases, as factors in his ankle injury.

Kim cracked bones in his ankles after neglecting an injury sustained during field supervisions in June, the source cited by Chosun Ilbo said. The source said Kim had surgery and is recovering at Bongwha Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members, according to the newspaper.

Surgery to the ankles could be consistent with gout, Alastair Hepburn, a consultant rheumatologist and a Medical Trustee of the U.K. Gout Society. “It’s unusual but it’s possible,” Hepburn said in a telephone interview. Severe gout can damage the joints, making an operation necessary, he said.

North Korea observers speculate Kim’s weight and family background may have contributed to his condition. “Based on his gait, it appears he has gout – something [due to] diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family,” said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North website.

Gout is a form of arthritis that isn’t fatal, though it can be agonizingly painful. The condition is caused by a buildup of a waste product in the blood called uric acid, which normally is eliminated from the body through urine, according to the U.K.’s National Health Service. Uric acid can cause needle-like crystals to form, which seep into joints and cause inflammation.

“Gout is a very painful and debilitating condition,” said Hepburn of the U.K. Gout Society. “It can lead to a situation when limping becomes obvious because of the pain. A person can be quite well for some time, and then there may be sudden flareups, which cause more pain.”

Chosun Ilbo’s report also said that Kim was believed to be wearing shoes with Cuban heels, a style of two-inch high-heeled men’s footwear, to make him taller and give him a more authoritative appearance. Kim is shown below wearing such shoes in a 2012 appearance with his wife, Ri Sol-ju:"
2024,"The artist posted a poignant image in the wake of the shooting that killed 12 at the offices of the French satirical magazine in Paris yesterday

Thousands of Banksy fans have shared this strong pictorial response to the terror attack at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

Masked gunmen stormed the offices in Paris, claiming the lives of 12 and leaving five more seriously injured, yesterday.

Among the dead were four of France’s most celebrated political cartoonists, Jean Cabu, Stephane “Charb” Charbonnier, Bernard “Tignous” Verlhac and Bernard Maris.

The following image was posted via this Instagram yesterday, which has since been shared by over 100,000 people:

However, a spokesperson for Banksy told The Independent: ""We can confirm this is not by Banksy.""

The account is actually one of many fakes (Twitter handles @Banksyofficial and @therealbanksy are also fake) set up in the street artist's name.

The drawing appears instead to be the work of illustrator Lucille Clerc:

Break one, thousand will rise #CharlieHebdo #JeSuisCharlie #raiseyourpencilforfreedom pic.twitter.com/3n5fOEmrwJ

His reaction follows that of Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, who released this statement.

“Very little seems funny today,” he concluded.

Gerard Biard, Charlie Hebdo’s editor-in-chief, who was in London at the time of the attack, said: “I don’t understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons. A newspaper is not a weapon of war.”

Barack Obama, David Cameron and Angela Merkel have all condemned the “barbaric” killings and vowed to stand up for freedom of expression.

Seven of the gunmen suspected of being involved in the attack have since been arrested. An 18-year-old accomplice also handed themself in to a police station.

Charlie Hebdo was firebombed in 2011 after they published a spoof issue “guest edited” by the Prophet Mohamed.

2025,"With the threat of an ISIS terror attack becoming ever more real, Iraqi media reported yesterday that some of the group’s militants have contracted the deadly Ebola virus, although World Health Organization officials have yet to confirm the reports.

An International Business Times article from today confirms that three Iraqi news outlets reported that Ebola showed up at a hospital in Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad which has been under ISIS control since June 2014.

Christy Feig, WHO’s director of communications, casted doubt on the report though, telling reporters, “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.”

On top of that, it isn’t clear whether any disease experts or doctors in Mosul are even able to test for the Ebola virus. A Kurdish official, who was convinced the cases are Ebola, told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants’ symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus.

Nonetheless, Ebola symptoms, like nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding, are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases, including malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever viruses, and the Marburg virus.

Iraq’s pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, reported that the disease arrived in Mosul from “terrorists” who came “from several countries” in Africa.

According to a Washington Post report, the majority of the ISIS’ African fighters came from Tunisia, while others came from Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan, and Somalia — none of which reported any Ebola cases in 2014.

Benjamin T. Decker, an intelligence analyst with the Levantine Group, said that over the past few weeks, militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul.

“U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,” he said.

Decker added, “In this context, the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.”"

2052,"It’s been a tough month for factchecking. After the Rolling Stone campus rape story unraveled, readers of all publications can be forgiven for questioning the process by which Americans get our news. And now it turns out that another blockbuster story is —to quote its subject in an exclusive Observer interview—”not true.”

Monday’s edition of New York magazine includes an irresistible story about a Stuyvesant High senior named Mohammed Islam who had made a fortune investing in the stock market. Reporter Jessica Pressler wrote regarding the precise number, “Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the “’high eight figures.’” The New York Post followed up with a story of its own, with the fat figure playing a key role in the headline: “High school student scores $72M playing the stock market.”

And now it turns out, the real number is … zero.

In an exclusive interview with Mr. Islam and his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov, the baby faced boys who dress in suits with tie clips came clean. Swept up in a tide of media adulation, they made the whole thing up.

Speaking at the offices of their newly hired crisis pr firm, 5WPR and handled by a phalanx of four including the lawyer Ed Mermelstein of RheemBell&Mermelsein, Mr. Islam told a story that will be familiar to just about any 12th grader—a fib turns into a lie turns into a rumor turns into a bunch of mainstream media stories and invitations to appear on CNBC.

Here’s how it happened.

Observer: What was your first contact with the New York magazine reporter?

Mohammed Islam: “My friend’s father worked at New York magazine and he had the reporter contact me. Then she [Jessica Pressler] called me.”

You seem to be quoted saying “eight figures.” That’s not true, is it?

No, it is not true.

The Post trumpeted the boys' investment success, as did New York magazine. (screencap)
The Post trumpeted the boys’ investment success, as did New York magazine. (screencap)

Is there ANY figure? Have you invested and made returns at all?

No.

So it’s total fiction?

Yes.

Are you interested in investing? How did you get this reputation?

I run an investment club at Stuy High which does only simulated trades.”

If you had been playing with real money, would you have done really well?

The simulated trades percentage was extremely high relative to the S&P.

Where did Jessica Pressler come up with the $72 million figure?

I honestly don’t know. The number’s a rumor.

She said ‘have you made $72 million’?

[I led her to believe] I had made even more than $72 million on the simulated trades.

At this point the PR reps jumped in with Law & Order style objections. A conference outside the room ensued. Back into the room came Mr. Islam.

All I can say is for the simulated trades, I was very successful. The returns were incredible and outperformed the S&P.

Damir, tell me where you fit into this.

Damir Tulemaganbetov: Well, I got excited by this whole trading thing and I said hey, let me get on board. I heard about this article coming out and Mohammed invited me and I met Jessica.

But you guys are pals outside of this?

We go to social gatherings and friends’ places.

Are you into stockpicking as well?

I haven’t been into it but I’m interested.

Mohammed, you’re from Queens and you go to this elite public high school. Is this a hobby of your parents as well or would you be the first person in your family to pursue high finance?

Mohammed Islam: In my immediate family, just me.

So what did your parents think when they’re reading that you’ve got $72 million?

Mohammed Islam: Honestly, my dad wanted to disown me. My mom basically said she’d never talk to me. Their morals are that if I lie about it and don’t own up to it then they can no longer trust me. … They knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and I haven’t spoken to them since.

You haven’t? Where did you sleep last night?

Mohammed Islam: At a friend’s house. But we didn’t sleep.

Damir Tulemaganbetov: We stayed awake all night. We’ve been checking out news all over the world.

Are your friends blowing up your phones?

Damir Tulemaganbetov: He had 297 unread messages and 190 LinkedIn. All the friends shared it.

Mohammed Islam: It was hyped up beyond belief.

Damir Tulemaganbetov: We were at CNBC. That’s why we’re dressed up. But we were there and literally in the building stressing out. We had 20 minutes. Then we three times asked them could we have 20 seconds to talk?

[The boys ended up cancelling the CNBC appearance.]

Where do you go from here?

Damir Tulemaganbetov: Socially, people will be mad about it. But we’re sorry. Especially ot our parents. Like my dad would read this and be like ‘Oh My God’ because he’s a very humble man and I portrayed him like a bad father.

Mohammed Islam: At school, first things first. I am incredibly sorry for any misjudgment and any hurt I caused. The people I’m most sorry for is my parents. I did something where I can no longer gain their trust. I have one sister, two years younger, and we don’t really talk.

 

So that’s that. There was no $72 million, no “eight figures,” not even one figure. The story is already coming unglued as the commenters on New York’s site hammer the reporter for even thinking this was possible. New York has now altered its headline to back away from the $72 million figure but the story itself remains. Even if this working-class kid had somehow started with $100,000 as a high school freshman on day one at Stuy High, he’d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796% over the three years since. C’mon, man.

It’s not hard to see why the story was tough to resist for New York, which placed Mr. Islam’s alleged acumen at No. 12 in its 10th annual “Reasons to Love New York” issue. Ms. Pressler quoted him saying, “It’s not just about money. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers …” Yep, nothing says success—or search engine optimization—quite like “Koch brothers.”

No one asked for my opinion, but I’m going to provide it anyway, having sat with these kids for a good bit on a tough day. They got carried away. They’re not children. But they’re not quite adults, either, and at least Mr. Islam was literally quaking as we spoke. So yeah, they probably should have known better. But New York and the New York Post probably should have, as well. This story smelled fishy the instant it appeared and a quick dance with the calculator probably would have saved these young men—and a couple reporters—some embarrassment.

2068,"Islamic State leaders in Syria and Iraq are training their fighters to fly captured fighter jets in the hope of establishing an air force, it has been claimed.

The terror group are understood to have been carrying out test flights the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, according to a British-based organisation monitoring the Syrian Civil War.

Having captured three fighter jets from the Syrian military, ISIS are using Iraqi pilots who were once officers in Saddam Hussein's air force to train Syria-based militants to operate the warplanes.

The news comes as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sought to mend its strained relations with ISIS, urging all jihadist groups operating in the Middle East to unite under the common cause of fighting against Western 'crusader' armies.

Fighter: It is not clear if ISIS' jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances, but witnesses said the planes appear to have been seized from the Syrian Air Force (pictured)

Power: ISIS has been steadily building a full-equipped military - including large tanks, such as the one pictured here in Raqqa). Much of the equipment in their possession has been seized from Syrian regime forces

Show of strength: ISIS militants take part in a military parade along the streets of Raqqa earlier this year

ISIS' alleged test flights over the Aleppo countryside are understood to be the first time the terror group - which seized control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq earlier this year - has taken to the air.

'They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for Saddam Hussein,' said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

'People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,' he said, citing witnesses near al-Jarrah military airport.

The airport, which was seized from the Syrian regime earlier this year, is approximately 45 miles from the Turkish border.

It is not clear if the jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances, but witnesses said the planes appear to be Soviet-built MiG 21 or MiG 23 models.

Leader: News of ISIS' test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with the group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured)

Declaration: Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year

Islamic State militants have been almost entirely driven out of the Syrian city of Kobane following a remarkable fightback by Kurdish forces who vowed to either defeat the terrorists or die trying.

The extremists have abandoned all of their positions in the city, except for two small pockets of resistance in the east of the city, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal said.

As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobane was imminent.

The massively outgunned Kurdish fighters had been pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre.

But with the help of the most intense U.S. and Arab bombing raids of the anti-ISIS campaign so far, the Kurdish forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over the past two days.

They have also managed to force the militants have not been killed to retreat further into the outskirts of the town.

News that ISIS have been almost entirely forced out of Kobane comes after two days of heavy air strikes by U.S. warplanes.

ISIS' alleged test flights come despite American and Arab warplanes carrying out dozens of bombing raids against the group in Syria.

The terrorists have regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and have overrun several military bases but this was the first time it had been able to pilot warplanes.

Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts had previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria, but the aircraft had appeared unusable, according to analysts and diplomats.

News of the test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's group.

In a statement released today, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - the notorious terror collective's Yemen-based franchise - urged jihadists throughout the Middle East to put their differences aside, according to Charlie Winter, a researcher on jihad at counter-terrorism think-tank Quilliam

The document is understood to have called for Al Qaeda - who are represented in Syria by the Nusra Front and Khorasan terror groups - to stop fighting with ISIS, adding that the militants should instead focus on attacking Western 'crusader' forces and carrying out strikes on American targets.

Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year.

Advance: The Islamic State and its allied Sunni militants seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year

Checkpoint: Earlier today, Iraqi officials in the western Anbar province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital Ramadi (pictured) over fears that the Islamic State group might try to advance on the city

Security: ISIS has been making gains around Ramadi in recent weeks against the embattled Iraqi military, despite ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on the militants

'We urge all Muslims to back their brethren, with their souls, money and tongues, against the crusaders,' the Al Qaeda statement reads.

It also urges Muslims to support 'whoever can weaken the Americans to weaken them militarily, economically, and media-wise.'

Earlier today, Iraqi officials in the western Anbar province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital Ramadi over fears that the Islamic State group might try to advance on the city.

Sabah Karhout, the chairman of the Anbar provincial council, says the curfew began at midnight this morning as part of an effort to limit movement in and out of the city.

ISIS has been making gains around Ramadi in recent weeks against the embattled Iraqi military, despite ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on the militants.

Two Iraqi military officials, speaking anonymously because they are not authorized to brief the media, say major operations are underway in Salahuddin province to retake key areas from the Sunni militants around Tikrit and the Beiji oil refinery.

ISIS and allied Sunni militants seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year.

The loss of Fallujah - where American troops engaged in some of the heaviest fighting of the more than eight-year U.S.-led war in the country - foreshadowed the later loss of Iraq's second city of Mosul and much of the north.

Six senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a symbol of the terrorists' expanding influence among Islamist groups.

Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS.

The move is likely to have serious consequences for security in Pakistan, particularly near the Afghan border where all six of the men are based, leaving it open to the kind of violence and brutal oppression ISIS has employed in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq under the group's control.

Militants: Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid (centre) and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS

The official announcement of the six men's declaration of allegiance to ISIS came in the form of an audio recording that emerged on Wednesday. However rumours had been circulating for weeks that several senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban were set to declare their loyalty to al-Baghdadi.

'I show allegiance to the commander of faithful, Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Qureshi al Hussaini, and will listen and obey every order of you and will follow your orders regardless of what circumstances may be,' Shahid said in the recording.

There is now concern that other senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban may defect to ISIS, including the group's overall leader Maulana Fazlullah, who has previously voiced support for the terror group.

Despite several members having declared their ISIS sympathies, the announcement is the first time any senior figure within the Pakistani Taliban has actually sworn allegiance to al-Baghdadi."

Many who shared the poignant drawing online believed it was created by the enigmatic street artist.

The drawing is actually by French illustrator Lucille Clerc, who posted the tribute on her official Twitter page after the shooting, which left 12 dead.

Several fake Banksy social media accounts have attracted thousands of followers, however the artist has confirmed on his official website that he is not on Facebook or Twitter.

2115,"An alleged attempted rapist in India received a grisly punishment for his alleged attack on a young teenager – an angry mob dragged him into a butcher’s shop where his penis was severed with a meat cleaver.

Suresh Kumar, 40, was set upon when locals in the city of Ganganagar in India’s north-western Rajasthan state heard a girl’s screams.

A mob dragged Kumar away after he was found in an alley allegedly pinning his victim to a wall – and then the group held a vigilante community meeting to decide what to do with him.

He was beaten with sticks for an hour, and dragged into a local butcher’s shop where his organ was severed with a meat cleaver.

It was thrown into the street.

Kumar is still in a critical condition after the attack.

Local man Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: ‘No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.’

‘We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.

‘This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that – if you do it you will be punished.’

.A police spokesman said: ‘People cannot take the law into your own hands.

‘As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.

2133,"There have been lots of “Comcast delivers bad customer service” stories lately — so overwhelming, in fact, that the company just appointed an executive to solve the problem amid worries that disgruntled customers could derail the company’s merger with Time Warner — but the latest story may be the worst: A Comcast customer says the company got him fired from the job.


Consumerist reports that the customer — known in the story only as ""Conal"" — began subscribing to Comcast in 2013 under a promotional offer, but almost immediately found himself charged for set-top boxes that had not been activated. He says he met with a Comcast rep in May of that year to sort out the billing issues, but they actually got worse from there.

He attempted to cancel, but was persuaded to stay for three free months of The Movie Channel; the company ended up sending him items he hadn't order and charged him more than $1,800 for them. Conal, an accountant, then contacted Comcast's controller. Consumerist reports: ""During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast’s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation.""

Here's where the problem develops: Comcast learned where Conal was employed. It just happened to be a company that does business with Comcast.

Consumerist reports that Conal claims he never named the company when he was on the phone with various customer service reps — he believes Comcast must've looked up the information somehow. Nonetheless:

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal’s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he’d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

When he was fired, Conal’s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.

Emphasis added.

Consumerist, never a Comcast-friendly publication to begin with, seethes:

""I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller’s office,"" writer Chris Moran says. ""Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.  And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn’t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he’d paid for.""

Comcast told Consumerist it ""will review (Conal's) lawyer’s letter and respond as quickly as possible.”"
2177,"On Monday morning, a report surfaced claiming that Comcast has been discouraging customers from using the Tor Browser, a browsing program designed to allow users to surf the Internet with greater anonymity than most browsers. Monday’s report was repackaged on a number of other sites, stating that Comcast has ""declared war on the Tor Browser."" The report goes on to suggest that Comcast has contacted some users telling them that they risk disconnection if they continue using Tor. The report may have generated a lot of clicks but is totally inaccurate.  

Comcast is not asking customers to stop using Tor, or any other browser for that matter. We have no policy against Tor, or any other browser or software. Customers are free to use their Xfinity Internet service to visit any website, use any app, and so forth. 

Here are the facts:

Comcast doesn’t monitor our customer’s browser software, web surfing or online history.

The anecdotal chat room evidence described in these reports is not accurate.  

We respect customer privacy and security and only investigate and disclose certain information about a customer's account with a valid court order or other appropriate legal process, just like other ISPs. More information about these policies can be found in our Transparency Report here.

We do not terminate customers for violating the Copyright Alert System (aka ""six strikes""), which is a non-punitive, educational and voluntary copyright program. Read more here.

Our customers can use Tor at any time, as I have myself.  I’m sure many of them are using it right now."
2198,"A 17-year-old transgender girl in Ohio committed suicide by walking into traffic early Sunday morning.

Leelah Alcorn, born Joshua Ryan, left behind a harrowing note posted on Tumblr that exposed the pain, frustration and rejection Leelah felt, including her feeling that “there’s no way out,” and her concern that she would never fully transition.

Leelah died around 2:20 a.m. Sunday after she was hit by a tractor trailer near the  South Lebanon exit of I-71. While initial news reports seemed to suggest her death was an accident, her note made her intentions clear:

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in… because I’m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally “boyish” things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids.

Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more Christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life.

On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

Later, she detailed her emotional turmoil.

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy.

Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse. That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me.

As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year.

I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s fucked up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.

2221,"MIAMI — The bulletin now falls squarely in the pantheon of unconfirmed phenomena, along with U.F.O.s, sightings of the Loch Ness monster and the breakup of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie:

Fidel Castro is dead.

Sooner or later, it will be true. But on Friday, for the umpteenth time, Miami was distracted by the rumor that Mr. Castro, 88, who has survived revolution, assassination attempts, countless cigars, substantial stress, a fall after leaving a stage and a life-threatening stomach ailment, had finally succumbed.

“Hope springs eternal,” said James Cason, the former head of the United States Interests Section in Cuba from 2002 to 2005 and now the mayor of Coral Gables, a wealthy enclave in Miami-Dade County. “He must have died 20 times since the time I went to Cuba.”

Cuban-Americans gathered in the usual spot, the Versailles restaurant on Calle Ocho, and other Cuban establishments to ponder the possibility that this time, maybe, maybe, it would be true. But even here in a city still fixated by Mr. Castro, rumor fatigue was obvious. Versailles had put its Fidel-is-dead game plan into action — assigning some parking spots to local TV and radio stations, but few showed up

It was no different at La Carreta, a restaurant in Westchester, Fla., a Cuban-American stronghold.

“There is always doubt about this; the joke is on us,” said Manolo Alvarez, 75, a retired painter, laughing as he held court with his friends in front of the Cuban cafecito counter. “But eventually it will happen. No one is immortal. And he will join the devil.”

Castro death alerts come fast and frequently these days. His age, ill health, long absence from public view and society’s shift from old-school rumor mill to hyperspeed Twitter feed make even debunked stories effortlessly spreadable. In fact, determining the provenance of each rumor has become a kind of modern-day parlor game.

In this case, the story probably stemmed from a simple mix-up, the death of a lesser-known namesake in a faraway country: Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, Raila Odinga, died on Sunday and was eulogized on Thursday. A similar mistake occurred in August 1997, when a Cuban revolutionary figure, Rene Orley Sanchez Castro, died in Cuba, spawning a swirl of speculation around the world.

Like most of the past false reports, the one on Friday was bolstered by tantalizing circumstantial droplets. The last time Mr. Castro was seen in public was Jan. 9, 2014, making Friday the first anniversary of his disappearance. And Mr. Castro, never at a loss for words, had failed to comment about December’s announcements by his younger brother, Raúl, and President Obama that the United States and Cuba would resume diplomatic ties.

There was also word on Friday of an abruptly scheduled news conference and chatter — true or not — about how the major roads to a famous revolutionary cemetery in Santiago de Cuba, where Mr. Castro reportedly will be buried, were being repaired.

The likeliest explanation for Mr. Castro’s absence is that he is, in fact, too mentally and physically frail to be seen or to speak.

“We don’t know what his physical state is because they never let you know,” Mr. Cason said of Cuban officials. “But they want him to be remembered as strong and vigorous. They don’t want him to be seen.”

Tales of Mr. Castro’s demise have surfaced for decades. In 1986, the State Department had to beat back a flurry of reports and questions from Miami about Mr. Castro’s apparent death. The sources of the speculation were varied and dubious: A ham radio operator in Havana, a nurse in Cuba who telephoned a friend in Miami, a report by an astrologer.

More rumors followed, off and on, and then accelerated after Mr. Castro vanished for a stretch in 2006 and, once again, after he relinquished power to his brother Raúl in 2008. Through the years, Mr. Castro has been rumored to have been stricken by heart attacks, brain hemorrhages, strokes and cancer. He has alternately delighted in and derided the many attempts to “kill him off early,” as he joked once in 1997.

“Now that our enemies have prematurely declared me dying or dead, I am happy to send my compatriots and friends around the world this short film material,” Mr. Castro said in 2006, after his absence.

In Miami, his death, when it is finally confirmed, will be historically momentous and, for most, cause for jubilation. The city will dust off its ever-evolving contingency plans. Even some private schools have early dismissal emails to parents at the ready.

But, to a certain extent, Mr. Castro’s death will also be anticlimactic. Years ago, his death was seen as the necessary prelude to a democratic Cuba and a return home for tens of thousands of exiles. With Raúl Castro firmly in place, that is no longer the case.

“If this had happened at the height of his power, or even when he was just fading, it would be different,” said Peter Hakim, a Cuba expert at the Inter-American Dialogue center in Washington. “This was almost a personal battle not to let Fidel win. Now, I think people are beginning to accept that Fidel has won. He will go to his grave with the government intact and the U.S. backing down from its unalterable commitment to unseat the regime he installed.”"
2223,"Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster has issued a new report to investors, breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices. The analyst predicts that the stainless steel Apple Watch will be priced at $499, while the 18k Gold Edition will sell for $4,999, AppleInsider reports. He also said that on average, consumers will spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Apple watch versions

Apple Watch will be released in three separate price tiers i.e. Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, with each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices. Starting with Apple Watch Sport, Munster expects an ASP (average selling price) of $450 including configuration choices like case and internal storage options. The stainless steel Apple Watch model is expected to start at $499 to $549, with an overall ASP at around $650. Regarding the Apple Watch Edition, the analyst forecasts the base model to start at $4,999, while classifying segment ASP at $7,500.

Based on current pricing for Apple’s silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars. 

“If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,” Munster writes. 

Lastly, Munster expects the Sport model to make up 55% of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take 45%. As for Apple Watch Edition, Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year.

Based on what we know so far about the Apple Watch, which model do you plan on getting?"
2232,"The British accent in the video that depicted the despicable and cowardly murder of an American journalist has raised concerns in the UK about the background of the ISIS jihadist. The Washington Post’s report on the butchery includes this nugget that should have Americans thinking twice, too:

In an interview with the BBC, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine.

Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.

“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it with former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.

Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.
The May 2004 Berg killing was conducted by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Tawhid wal-Jihad at the beginning of the 2003 Iraq war, which became al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) at around the time of that beheading. US forces killed Zarqawi in an American airstrike, but AQI survived his death and the Anbar Awakening (if barely) to morph into ISIS when the US pulled out of Iraq. Berg was not the only American beheaded by Zarqawi, either; he also killed Owen Eugene Armstrong later in the same year, and both Berg and Armstrong wore orange jumpsuits when murdered, as did James Foley.

The orange jumpsuits are obviously referencing Guantanamo Bay, but the British seem concerned that there’s more than just symbolism now in play with ISIS. The US began releasing British subjects from Gitmo during the Bush administration under international pressure to shut down the facility, as well as releasing other detainees to their home countries, all of whom pledged to ensure that they would not return to the fight. We’ve seen plenty of recidivism since then, and all to this same end — to rejoin the jihad against the West and the nations in this region, and to recruit others to do the same.

It won’t be a surprise if the jihadist turns out to be a former Gitmo detainee, but it is a bit of a surprise that the UK doesn’t keep a close enough watch on those former detainees to account for their whereabouts immediately. After all, they have already been identified as threats, picked up in the battle zones far from home, which is how they ended up in Gitmo in the first place. The bigger worry for the UK — and for the US and other Western nations — will be how many of these butchers will make it back home undetected and anonymous. It should also have us taking great care not to release those who still present a danger, especially since we’re now desperately looking for ways to roll back ISIS. Perhaps we shouldn’t provide them more fighters than they already have."

2266,"Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) claimed Tuesday that ""at least"" 10 Islamic State fighters were apprehended while attempting to enter the U.S. at its southern border.

The San Diego Republican said U.S. Border Patrol ""sources"" told him that ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""

""If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border -- it’s that simple,"" he said. ""They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or 10 of them then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,"" he said on Fox News’ ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren.""

""ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons,"" he added. ""The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border -- which they already have.""

Two of the country's top intelligence officials said last month they had no credible evidence to support the theory that militants are operating next door, nor that they are plotting to sneak across the border.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that Hunter's claim otherwise was ""categorically false.""

""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron told The Huffington Post. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

Hunter, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, isn't the first member of Congress to raise the alarm about the prospect of extremists crossing the border. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested last month that such infiltration was possible, and Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) said it was already happening. Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) has also sounded similar notes about terrorists crossing his state's border from Mexico. GOP Rep. Tom Cotton, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Arkansas, claimed Tuesday that extremists were actively collaborating with Mexican drug cartels to infiltrate the U.S. border and attack Arkansans.

Asked for comment on Wednesday, a spokesman for Hunter said the information came for a ""high level source"" and that DHS was ""actively discouraging any talk of IS on the border.""

""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper told The Huffington Post. ""And as for DHS’ statement, it makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing -- it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change. No surprise there."""
2272,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — The leader of Boko Haram has denied agreeing to any cease-fire with the Nigerian government, and said he married off the more than 200 schoolgirls that the Islamic extremist group kidnapped.

In a new video released late Friday night, Abubakar Shekau dashed hopes for a prisoner exchange to get the girls released.

""The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,"" he said, laughing. ""In this war, there is no going back.""

Nigeria's chief of defense staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, on Oct. 17 announced that Boko Haram had agreed to an immediate cease-fire to end a 5-year-old insurgency that has killed thousands of people, and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in northeast Nigeria.

But attacks and abductions have continued, with the extremists this week seizing Mubi, a town of more than 200,000 people. Fighting also continued Friday in Vimtin, the nearby village where Badeh was born.

Shekau in August announced that Boko Haram wanted to establish an Islamic caliphate, along the lines of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. Fleeing residents have reported that hundreds of people are being detained for infractions of the extremists' version of strict Shariah law in several towns and villages under their control.

Boko Haram's kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls taking exams at a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April prompted an international campaign for their release and criticism of Nigeria's government for not acting quickly to free them. Dozens of the girls escaped on their own in the first few days, but 219 remain missing. The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls has been used on social media sites, including Facebook and Twitter, in an effort to spark conversation about the kidnappings. Nobel Peace Prize laureate and international education activist Malala Yousafzai visited Nigeria in July, and urged Boko Haram to free the kidnapped girls, calling them her ""sisters.""

Unconfirmed reports have indicated that the girls have been broken up into several groups, and that some may have been carried across borders into Cameroon and Chad.

The government had said it had negotiated with two Boko Haram leaders in Chad, with talks hosted by President Idriss Deby, and that it was confident the girls would be freed soon. But Boko Haram has many factions.

Shekau's announcement further discredits the government of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who on Thursday formally announced his candidacy for elections on Feb. 14, 2015, in Africa's most populous nation. Nigeria, with some 160 million people, is divided almost equally between Muslims who dominate the north and Christians in the south. The West African nation is the biggest oil producer on the continent and has its biggest economy.

Jonathan's failure to curtail the insurgency and many corruption scandals are not expected to dim his chances of success. The election, though, is expected to be the most hotly contested since his People's Democratic Party took power after decades of military dictatorship ended in 1994.

Dozens of ruling party legislators have defected to the coalition All Progressives Congress, losing the PDP its majority in the lower house of Parliament. But the coalition is weakened by its inability to choose a presidential candidate, and primaries in December will be contested by three powerful northerners who all are Muslim.

Jonathan, a Christian from a minority southern tribe, has been criticized for ignoring an unwritten party rule to alternate power between Christian and Muslim leaders, adding a religious and ethnic dimension to the election.

2288,"The copper box was entombed in the state capitol in 1795

Someone call Nicholas Cage because Bostonians may have just discovered a new real-life national treasure.

A time capsule from 1795 in the form of a small copper box was unearthed in Massachusetts statehouse in Boston Thursday. The container was first placed in the cornerstone of the building on Beacon Hill by revolutionary war hero Paul Revere and the then-governor of Massachusetts, Samuel Adams.

The cigar-box sized capsule will be x-rayed over the weekend and its contents revealed next week. The artifact is believed to be one of the oldest time capsules in Massachusetts, making it by default one of the oldest such items in the United States.

2314,"It's bad enough how much they crop it. Now I noticed what I thought was a speeding up. Turns out they speed it up a full 7.5 percent.

The test:

My computer has a tuner card. I used this tuner card to digitally record Seinfeld from Fox Chicago roughly 10 years ago (I archived the entire series). Then I found which episode was on TBS tonight. In the upper-right window is a live feed from the tuner card. The source is TBS's SD feed via Dish Network. The lower-right is video playback from the digital recording, also recorded from Dish Network in 2003. I fed the audio from both the live feed and the video clip as well as the video from the S-video out on my video card to an external DVD recorder, then uploaded the final result to youtube. After 202 seconds of playback, the TBS live feed had advanced a full 15 seconds over the recording. This amounts to nearly 2 minutes over the course of a full episode.


I lined up the windows as closely as possible so you can also see cropping. Between that and the extreme speed increase, TBS is butchering a classic."

Justin Bieber’s song has saved a Russian man from being mauled by a bear.

Fishing in the Yakutia Republic, Russia, Igor Vorozhbitsyn is lucky to be alive after his Justin Bieber ringtone, Baby, scared off a bear that was attacking him.

""I couldn't believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” Vorozhbitsyn told the Croatian Times.

Vorozhbitsyn, 42, was walking to his angling spot when a bear ambushed him from behind.

""I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I'd marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me,"" he said.

But as the bear clawed Vorozhbitsyn’s face and back his mobile phone rang, the ringtone selected was Justin Bieber’s hit song Baby. Rightly startled, the bear retreated back into the forest.

Vorozhbitsyn was able to call for help on his phone and was rescued by fishermen.

Vorozhbitsyn said he has his granddaughter to thank for his ringtone selection.

“I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,"" he said.

Wildlife experts believe the ringtone must have startled the bear enough to halt its attack, reports the Croatian Times.

""Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,"" an expert said.

Vorozhbitsyn suffered cuts and bruises to his face and chest and is now recovering."
2335,"Tampa, Florida -- She's an Internet sensation: Jasmine Tridevil, the 21-year-old Tampa woman who claims to have had a third breast implanted. Her video on YouTube has almost a million hits and her pictures on Facebook have gone global.

10 News spoke with her in an exclusive interview.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" said Tridevil.

She agreed to the interview on the condition we only discuss her self-produced show she hopes will be picked up by a cable network, and when we asked to see her third breast, she obliged, but with only a quick flash. When asked her why we couldn't have a longer look Tridevil responded, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that, but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags.

""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person,"" said Greenwald.

And Jasmine's reaction to that.

2336,"Multi-millionaire religious ""guru"" Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh persuaded around 400 of his estimated 50 million followers worldwide to cut off their own testicles to ""bring them closer to God"".  The details of the bizarre incident have only just come to light despite reportedly taking place in 2000 at a hospital run by Ram Rahim in India.  India's Central Bureau of Investigation has reportedly accused Ram Rahim of grievous bodily harm and he is under investigation. He has previously been questioned over the murder of an investigative journalist in 2002 and has also been accused of sexual assault by female followers but has never been charged.  Navkiran Singh, who is the lawyer for Hans Raj Chauhan, the only castration victim so far to come forward, said his client and other victims believed they would become social outcasts if they refused to perform the ""operation"" demanded of them by Ram Rahim. ""They were told that only those who get castrated will be able to meet God,"" said Navkiran, in a report in the Daily Mail.  Ram Rahim, 47, dubbed the ""guru in bling"", is head of the socio-political organisation Dera Sacha Sauda and is estimated to be worth £26m. The guru stars in a spectacular new movie, Messenger of God, in which he appears to walk on air, tear tree trunks in half and perform other miracles. Though 157,000 people are thought to have attended the film's premiere in Gurgaon, near Delhi, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the revelations have caused sales of tickets for the movie to dwindle dramatically.  Gurus are big business in India, where their endorsements can help political parties get elected, and where millions of people seek spiritual guidance every year. Sathya Sai Baba, who was said to be able to conjure ash from thin air, was worth an estimated US$7bn when he died.  Even after death, some gurus retain a hold over devotees. Ashutosh Maharaj, who was certified deceased by medical examiners last year, has had his body frozen by followers who apparently believe he is merely in a state of deep meditation called ""samadhi"".

2365,"When Apple introduced its Apple Watch in September, the company said there would be three editions along with various face options and bands. Customers will literally have dozens of watch configurations to choose from. Only the base model got an official price of $349, however. Now a report claims to have pricing information on other editions.

MacRumors spotted a French blog whose sources suggest the stainless steel Apple Watch variant will start at $500 while gold models could cost $4,000 and up. The iGen blog has been credible in the past, correctly predicting the size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

If you take the view that Apple Watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget, the prices may not make that much sense. Look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts, though, and the anticipated costs sound viable. Apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist. It’s already considered a luxury brand by many and people are clearly willing to pay premium prices for that brand.

The stainless steel pricing is certainly believable to me. Look at Pebble to see why.

Pebble Steel fashion

 


You can buy a plastic Pebble smartwatch for as little as $99 now, recently discounted from its $149 price. The same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you $199, or double the plastic model’s price. It’s reasonable to assume an Apple Watch with stainless steel casing will cost $500 based on that. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap, with an additional $50 to $100 cost for a matching stainless steel strap.

Unfortunately, we’re not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring, as Apple won’t be selling the Apple Watch until then. For now, potential customers have time to save up for Apple’s timepiece — something they may need to do if they want an Apple Watch in gold."

According to CNN, the comedian’s personal doctor took a selfie in the operating room while Rivers was under anesthesia, and also performed a biopsy on her vocal cords without her prior consent. Yorkville's medical director Lawrence Cohen, who has since been let go from his post, was the one originally performing the endoscopy on Rivers. It is believed Cohen then stepped aside to let Rivers' personal doctor — who was not authorized to practice at the clinic — perform the unauthorized biopsy that ultimately caused her to go into cardiac arrest. The doctor named in these accusations has yet to be identified."

A military historian, and popular Twitter microblogger using the handle @ArmedResearch, is reporting a huge explosion of an oil pipeline belonging to Saudi Aramco near Sudair.

With all eyes on Saudi and crude right now, speculation and conspiracy theories immediately emerged on social media concerning the news. Here are two of the most interesting hypotheses I've seen:

This is a way to get oil prices to go back up without the Saudis appearing to give in and defend price by voluntarily cutting supply. A pipeline explosion will automatically decrease production.
The US Elections are over, time for prices at the pump to go back up now. This plays on the long-tenured theory that gasoline prices tend to be lowest right before elections as the incumbent party leverages their power to please the masses.

2428,"It wasn’t very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he’d like an epidemic of Ebola.

But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when.

And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?

Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.

And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.

But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldn’t be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside.

A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California’s big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural?

With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing.

At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city.

And Bettman hasn’t been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot.

It’s been 15 years since the NHL expanded — and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced.

And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota.

Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork:

“There’s a lot of interest. We’re hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City,” Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games.

“We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. It’s not something we’ve seriously considered yet.”

Like hell it isn’t. They’d have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously.

And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear — one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix.

But could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True there’s a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise can’t seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all.

And while Kansas City isn’t really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they’re going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen.

Going back to Minnesota has been a success, and there’s no question there’s more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity.

There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if it’s true, after such a long wait this trivial detail — which only troubles the fans — isn’t going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this.

And any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that’s paying their salaries.

Expansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved."
2430,"Iraqi forces reach centre of northern city of Baiji in attempt to break the Isis siege of the country’s biggest refinery

Authorities in Iraq were tonight investigating claims that the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been “critically injured” in US-led air strikes, prompting speculation of his death.

The death of the elusive leader would mark a significant change in the US-led effort to curtail the Islamist extremist group. Britain’s chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nicholas Houghton, warned, however, that the Isis leadership would regenerate even if Baghdadi had been killed.

General Houghton told the BBC: “I can’t absolutely confirm that Baghdadi has died. Even the Americans themselves are not yet in a position to do that. Probably it will take some days to have absolute confirmation.”

Friday’s strikes destroyed an Isis convoy near the Iraqi city of Mosul, but US officials said it was unclear whether the group’s top commander had been in any of the 10 targeted vehicles. Tribal sources told the Saudi news channel Al Arabiya that after the strike Isis members scrambled to transport the wounded to al-Qaim hospital which was overwhelmed with the injured.

Meanwhile, Iraqi military forces reached the centre of the northern city of Baiji on Sunday, trying to break the Isis siege of the country’s biggest refinery, outside the city. This led to fierce fighting. Sunni insurgents had seized Baiji in June, during a lightning advance through northern Iraq. Since then, they surrounded the refinery and halted its production, while a detachment of government troops inside has held out for months under siege.

An Iraqi colonel said troops had entered Baiji, a city of about 200,000 people, from the south and west and took over the al-Tamim neighbourhood and city centre. Isis had placed bombs along the roads and deployed snipers to keep the government forces from advancing – tactics used in other cities held by the ultra-hardline Sunni group, which controls swathes of both Iraq and Syria."

2486,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

2491,"n a most horrific form of child abuse, young children in a school in Ekurh, Johannesburg, South Africa, were caught imitating the cruel sport of dog fighting, while other students placed bets on who the winner would be, reports iolnews.com.

Inspector Wendy Willson, from the special investigations unit at the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA), was called to a school in Springs in June to intervene, when a school principal noticed a pattern of children as young as eight-years-old returning from recess, injured and with their clothes torn.

Willson stated the children had been taught the disgusting action after adults, on weekends, would encourage them to watch dog fights and role play fights of their own with other children. The youngsters would get down on all fours and scratch, bite, bark and kick each other. The winner of the match would then get to ""mate"" with a child as a reward. It was unknown if the children actually had sexual intercourse. That was done in imitation of the winning dogs mating with the female dogs.

Willson stated while watching one video, if she closed her eyes and listened to the children fighting, the growls, barks, etc. sounded exactly like dogs in a canine dog fight.

As the children get older, Willson stated they become involved in the thefts of dogs, their training and in fights. One child was recorded as saying:

“It makes me feel like laughing. It makes me feel powerful.""

During her investigation, Willson could find no other examples of such egregious horror except in the Gauteng Department of Education school district.

Teddy Bear Clinic director Shaheda Omar, a non profit dedicated to helping abused children, also stated it was first time she had ever come in contact with children role playing dog-fighting, but addressed it as an extremely disturbing act:

""These children are being used. They are like cogs in a machine. I’m sure some sort of reward is offered and they are being socialized into that behavior. Violence begets violence and the children are learning it from adults.”

As if dog fighting isn't bad enough for the canine victims of this egregious activity; now children are being taught."
2500,"(CNN) -- Joan Rivers' personal throat doctor denies ""performing an unauthorized procedure"" before the comedian suffered cardiac arrest, a source close to the doctor told CNN.

Dr. Gwen Korovin also ""categorically denies"" taking a selfie photo while Rivers was under anesthesia at a medical clinic, the same source said Thursday.

The statement disputes what a source close to the Rivers death investigation told CNN -- that staff members at the clinic told investigators Korovin snapped the selfie and also performed an unauthorized procedure on Rivers.

Rivers, 81, died a week after suffering cardiac arrest during an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic.

CNN's source close to the investigaton also provided new details Thursday, including that a sedated Rivers was visible in Korovin's procedure room selfie.

Clinic workers told investigators they heard Korovin make a statement to the effect that Rivers ""will think this is funny"" or ""would love this"" as she took the photo, the source said.

Investigators do not have access to the phone Korovin used to take the photo, the source said.

The source also provided more specific information about what procedures were done on Rivers.

Several clinic workers told investigators that it began with Korovin performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds.

Gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was the medical director of the clinic until resigning in the wake of Rivers' death, then performed an endoscopy intended to diagnose why she was suffering a sore and hoarse throat, the source said.

Cohen detected something of concern, the source said..

Korovin then began a second laryngoscopy to again view River's vocal cords, the source said. It was at that time that her vocal cords began to swell, leading to a cut off of oxygen to her lungs and ultimately to cardiac arrest, according to the source.

Rivers was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later.

Korovin was only authorized to observe Cohen, who performed the procedure since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source said.

Investigators have found no prior consent form signed by Rivers authorizing a procedure by Korovin, the source said. It was unclear if Rivers had given verbal consent to the biopsy before being sedated.

Korovin is well known for helping an impressive list of celebrities with voice trouble. The list of famous patients who have sung her praises include actors Hugh Jackman and Nathan Lane and singers Celine Dion, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande.

The walls of Korovin's Manhattan medical office are covered with autograph photos, including from operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Broadway star Barbara Cook and actress-singer Julie Andrews.

""I've always been fascinated by the human voice and music,"" Korovin, 55, is quoted telling the New York Daily News in a profile story last year.

Korovin's lawyer sent a statement to CNN Thursday in response to the reports:

""Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

""As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient.

""For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.""

The clinic is still open, although an accreditation group is calling for it to suspend procedures and surgeries, according to letters obtained by CNN. Patients were seen in the clinic's waiting room Wednesday.

The American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities (AAAASF) sent representatives for an unscheduled visit to the clinic after hearing about Rivers' cardiac arrest, according to letters from the group.

The letters cited two ""deficiencies"" found by the representatives, declared the clinic to be in ""immediate jeopardy"" and placed it on ""emergency suspension."" The accreditation group said the clinic should stop procedures and surgeries ""until accreditation questions are settled.""

The clinic sent CNN a statement Wednesday night in response to questions about the accreditation association's letter putting the facility under ""emergency suspension.""

""Yorkville Endoscopy continues to maintain its federal, state and Quad A (AAAASF) authorization to be operational and provide patient care. Yorkville Endoscopy is committed to adhering to the standards established by Quad A (AAASF),"" the statement said.

While the accreditation agency has no power to shut a clinic down, the state of New York does. State health investigators also found deficiencies in Rivers' treatment, according to a source close to the death investigation. These include the participation of River's personal throat doctor.

Timeline emerges in Joan Rivers' death

Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released.

The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures. ... Nor is he currently serving as medical director.""

The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators.

The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law.

Serial killer Charles Manson's supposed budding romance with a woman 53 years his junior has been allegedly exposed as a money-making scheme.

According to journalist Daniel Simone, 27-year old Afton Elaine Burton, now known as Star, was hoping that she would gain possession of Manson's corpse through marriage so she and a couple of friends could put it on display in a glass case in LA.

They apparently thought the Lenin's Tomb-esque attraction would draw a huge number of visitors and make a lot of money.

But Manson, 80, apparently got wind of the plan and now no longer wants to marry Burton.

""He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool,"" Simone told The NY Post.

The tourist attraction was also something of a non-starter because Manson believes he is immortal.

""He feels he will never die,"" Simone added. ""Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.""

Manson and Burton's marriage license expired on Thursday, though Burton apparently remains hopeful that it will be renewed.

Perhaps Manson had the last laugh though - Simone claims he never intended to marry and was stringing Burton and her friends along with the prospect of a wedding as they continued to bring him toiletries and other items."
2506,"Fidel Castro was pronounced dead on Twitter sometime around 3:59 p.m. on Thursday. It was an unconfirmed rumor, of course, but it was announced confidently so many folks assumed it was true — or at least worthy of retweet.

Then separate rumors started about Raul Castro calling a press conference at 9 a.m. or 11 a.m. today, allegedly to announce his brother’s death.


As South America’s Twittersphere caught fire, some started questioning whether the users in their feed were even talking about the right Fidel Castro. After all, Al Jazeera reported on Jan. 4 that the  Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of Kenya’s main opposition leader, died in Nairobi last weekend after a night of drinking with friends. Could it be that Twitter users were confusing the dead Kenyan man with his Cuban namesake?


Twitter heatmap shows mention of “Fidel Castro” from 10 a.m. Thursday- 8 a.m today (GMT).

An overly excited Wikipedian edited the entry for Cuba’s Fidel Castro to say “this article is about a person who has recently died.” Moments later, the Castro’s Wikipedia entry was reverted back and to his undead version.

By 8 p.m., media outlets around Latin America were reporting “strong rumors” about Castro’s death and the alleged forthcoming announcement by Cuban officials.


But on the island, where folks are more accustomed to rumors of Castro’s death, the situation seemed less urgent. Journalists in Havana said they were aware of the rumors, but weren’t finding echo on the streets of Cuba. It’s true Castro hasn’t been seen in public in a year, but rumors of his death — as Mark Twain might have said — appeared to be greatly exaggerated.


As journalists turned to each other for answers, Cuba watchers tuned into state television.When Castro dies, that’s where it will be announced unequivocally."
2507,"Mouthwatering photos of school lunches served around the world reveal even children in Ukraine, Estonia and Greece are treated to delectable meals each day. School children in America, meanwhile, aren't nearly so lucky.

Whereas a kid in France might be treated to a juicy steak and a hunk of brie, the richest country in the world's youths are more likely to receive unidentified meat served alongside little more than a starch like white pasta, fries or a roll.

The contrasts between America's school meals and those in far less fortunate economies are stark and suggest Michelle Obama's push for more healthful lunches nationwide may not be enough.

What is it? School lunches in the United States stand in stark contrast to the wholesome and in some cases even decadent meals served to kids in other markedly less fortunate nations

The first new school lunch standards championed by Michelle Obama have been phased in over the last several school years.

In addition to whole grain requirements, the rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. While many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly.

Backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag #thanksMichelleObama. If these pictures are any indication, schools have responded to the rules by cutting down on portions to reduce fat and calories rather than by using potentially more costly ingredients.

Meanwhile, the widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently.

Photos of the meals appear on Sweetgreen.com.

But in the UK and US, lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin.

South Indian school children eat off a thali plate which has white rice, sambar (dhal), smoked gourd vegetable stir-fry, curd, buttermilk and kesari, a type of sweet dessert made from semolina

The school lunch comparisons were revealed by Sweetgreen, a chain of US restaurants, and website Never Seconds, run by Scottish schoolgirl Martha Payne, who logs her thoughts and experiences of eating school meals at her primary school in Lochgilphead, Scotland.

The 12-year-old launched the blog in 2012 as a school writing project with assistance from her father, David,

Written under the pseudonym 'VEG' (Veritas Ex Gustu – truth from tasting), with the subtitle 'One primary school pupil's daily dose of school dinners', the blog features daily entries on the $3 school meal that Martha/ 'VEG' has chosen that day, her thoughts on the food and its quality, a count of the number of hairs, a health rating, a picture, and marks out of 10 based on a 'Food-o-Meter'.

Martha, who has been invited to talk in international conferences is currently raising money for Scottish charity Mary's Meals, through her JustGiving page.

Mary's Meals - which began in 2002 as a one-off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and South America.

The surprising pictures show just how the UK and US measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren.

While the majority of lunches feature fresh foods, US tray is packed with processed items.

Similarly the typical UK school lunch is sadly lacking in fresh vegetables, featuring a baked potato, sausage and beans from a tin, and a half corn on the cob with a melon slice to follow.

Lunch in an Estonian school is rice with a piece of meat and purple cabbage. They also have bread and a get a cup of chocolate drink

School lunch in Alba, Spain (left): white flesh peaches, strawberries and yogurt melts, cous-cous, broccoli, cucumbers and roasted salmon; (right): Poached apple pears, strawberries and blue berries, boiled swede and fresh garden peas

In France, children start their meal with a generous slab of Brie.

This is followed by a hearty portion of rare steak, served with two types of vegetables - carrots and green beans.

And you won't find sweets on this lunch tray. The healthy theme continues into dessert, with the young ones tucking into kiwi fruit and apples.

The South Korean lunch is equally as impressive.

A milky fish soup to start followed by a serving of stir fried rice with tofu, broccoli and peppers. On the side is kimchi, the traditional Korean condiment of fermented cabbage.

In Scandinavia, Finnish schools dish up a vegetarian lunch of pea soup, beetroot salad, carrots and a roll. For pudding there is pannakkau, a sweet pancake served with strawberries and blueberries.

2524,"President Obama said Wednesday that the United States “will be vigilant and we will be relentless” against Islamic State militants and would “do what’s necessary to see that justice is done” following the videotaped execution of an American journalist.

“Today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIL,” Obama said, using one of several acronyms for the group. The militants, who posted the video on YouTube Tuesday, said Foley’s killing was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq.

Obama, who spoke Wednesday morning to Foley’s parents, offered no new policy measures to confront Islamic State. Referring to neighboring countries and U.S. allies, he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread.”

Asked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes, one U.S. official said the “only question is if we do more.” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month.

Obama could face pressure to escalate the air campaign in Iraq and increase support to U.S.-backed rebels in Syria who are fighting against the Islamic Front, as well as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U.S. heavy weapons, including portable surface-to-air missiles, as well as for American air support.

In a statement issued after the president’s remarks, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, “We must get serious about confronting this force, including by aggressively arming those battling it.”

The White House confirmed early Wednesday that U.S. intelligence had deemed the video authentic. Obama spoke in Martha’s Vineyard, where he is vacationing with his family.

Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native and a photojournalist working for the Boston-based Web site Global­Post, was kidnapped in northern Syria nearly two years ago while covering the civil war in Syria.

In Britain Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria, amid indications that a British citizen was involved in Foley’s killing. In the video, his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent.

After beheading Foley, the executioner is pictured with a second captive, identified as U.S. freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff, who disappeared last year in Syria. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the executioner says.

In an interview with the BBC, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine. Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.

“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it to the speech of former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.

Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.

Foley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012.

In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foley’s mother wrote: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim,” Diane Foley wrote. “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.

“We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”

Praising James Foley as “an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected.

In addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, according to a 2013 Global­Post article, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012. No one has claimed to be holding them.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66 journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda.

The Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.

As the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States.

In April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the group’s control.

This month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.

On Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil.

Within hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes. “We will drown all of you in blood,” it said.

The title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites.

A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,” the masked man says.

The video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” he says. He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq.”

The prisoner also appeals to “my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force,” to “think about what you are doing.”

“I wish I had more time,” he says. “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t an American.”

The masked man then identifies the prisoner as “James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.” He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner; the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its back.

The masked man then appears with another prisoner, identified as Sotloff, in a similar kneeling position.

Foley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi. According to Global­Post, two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver-colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012.

Since then, Global­Post “has mounted an extensive international investigation . . . to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held,” Global­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday.

2528,"Intelligence agencies hunting for identity of jihadist who murdered reporter

Reports have suggested Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a 23-year-old from London

Abu Hussain al-Britani, 20, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, also potential match

Young men have posed with heads and 'launched cyber attacks on West'

Security sources say they are 'zeroing in' on suspected matched

Police are preparing to raid several British homes to help establish identity

Man in video known as 'John', reportedly in British group called 'the Beatles'

Theresa May poised to bring in new laws to tackle British extremists

Three British men waging jihad in the Middle East alongside the Islamic State (IS) have emerged as potential identities for the masked extremist who killed James Foley in a brutal propaganda video.
The men, all in their early twenties, are thought to be in the IS capital of Raqqa, Syria. They enter the frame as security sources say MI5 are getting closer to discovering who the executioner, known only as 'John', could be.
The fighter, who spoke with a British accent, butchered Mr Foley, an American journalist, in front of cameras, claiming it was retaliation for U.S. air strikes on the Islamic State (formerly ISIS).

A French prisoner who was held captive by 'John' says he was part of a group of British jihadists who call themselves 'The Beatles'.
Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, a former rapper from London, Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, in his 20s, from Portsmouth, have been mooted as identities for 'John'.
According to reports in The Sun newspaper, some of the men have similar voices, and even use similar language, to that used in the video.

Security forces have revealed that the information contained in the horrific footage has allowed them to 'zero in' on the wanted man. 
Meanwhile, police are preparing to raid the homes of several Britons in order to help establish his identity, according to a report in The Times. Their drive to find 'John' comes as the Home Secretary announced that she was poised to bring in new laws to tackle British extremists.
Bary, one of the British jihadists, has posted sickening images online of himself posing with the severed heard of a Syria soldier, accompanied by a joke.

Abu Hussain al-Britani, who lived in Birmingham, was jailed in 2012 for stealing personal information from former Prime Minister Tony Blair.
The jihadist, real name Junaid Hussian, later left for Syria, where it has been reported that he is helping mastermind jihadist cyber attacks on British banks and celebrities to further swell the IS war coffers.

Meanwhile, Abu Abdullah Al-Britani, who often uses Twitter to post pro-IS propaganda online, is believed to be behind social media accounts attempting to recruit teenagers to join fighting in the Middle East.
In June, MailOnline revealed an account on the ask.fm social media site, believed to be operated by al-Britani, which gave self-identified youths advice on how to travel to Syria and Iraq and perks of the job from working with IS.
It comes as British intelligence operatives continue to use advanced recognition software to match known suspects to 'John's' voice.
Security sources revealed to The Times that, thanks to information posted online, MI5 is now 'zeroing in' on the wanted man.
It was also revealed that police are preparing to raid the homes of several Britons to help to establish the identity of the jihadist. Meanwhile, a small group of officers from the FBI is understood to be arriving to help British forces with their investigation.
Strict security protocols have also reportedly been put in place to stop classified information leaking to the wanted jihadists or their associates. 
In an interview yesterday, Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond said: 'Our intelligence agencies and police are studying the material that we have received.
'You wouldn't expect me to give a running commentary on that process, but we are devoting significant amounts of resource to identifying the individual.' 
He also ruled out an alliance with the Assad regime in Syria to combat the Islamic State (formerly Isis), saying that 'my enemy's enemy is not my friend'.
His statement comes as the Home Secretary announced that she was poised to bring in new laws to tackle British extremists.
Theresa May said Britain must introduce all the legal powers necessary to win the struggle against terror that is feared to last for decades.
Banning orders for extremist groups will be looked at again alongside powers to stop radical preachers.

Mrs May also underlined changes to the law that mean naturalised Britons who are fighting overseas can be stripped of their citizenship and excluded.
Yesterday it emerged that the group holding Mr Foley has demanded the release of al-Qaeda scientist Aafia Siddiqui. 
The Pakistani mother-of-three, 42, is serving 86 years in a Texas jail for plotting to spread Ebola and make a dirty bomb.

It came as Mr Foley's brother Michael urged officials to reconsider their policy of not negotiating in order to save another US journalist, Steven Sotloff.
He said: 'I hope that Jim's death pushes us to take another look at our approach.'
General Martin Dempsey, Chariman of President Obama's Joint Chiefs of Staff, yesterday warned that IS had an 'apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision' and could only be defeated by a coalition of partners."
2545," Saturated fats have long been called ''bad fats'' for their effect on the heart. But a new analysis calls into question whether they're really that bad after all.

The findings, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, have sparked renewed debate about fats and heart health.

The new study should trigger a review of current diet guidelines for heart health, according to the researchers who did the analysis. Other experts, including one from the American Heart Association, disagree.

There is some common ground. All agree that dietary fat is just one factor that drives heart disease risk. Paying attention to the other factors is also important.

WebMD asked a study co-author, a cardiologist, a nutrition expert, and the American Heart Association to elaborate.

What did the analysis look at and find?

Researchers looked at 72 published studies on fats and heart disease. The studies involved more than 600,000 people from 18 countries. Some people already had heart disease, while others did not. The researchers reanalyzed the results, an approach called a meta-analysis.

They looked at whether different fats helped or hurt your heart. The different fats included:

Saturated fats (found in meats, whole-fat dairy products, and baked goods)
Polyunsaturated fats, such as omega-3 and omega-6 (found in fish, nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils)
Monounsaturated fats (found in olive and canola oils)
Trans fats (found in fried foods and baked goods, and being phased out of the food supply)
The surprise? Saturated fats, long thought to raise heart disease risks, had no effect. Neither did monounsaturated fats, which are thought to help the heart, says study researcher Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, at the Harvard School of Public Health.

Which fats did have an effect? Trans fats, known to raise bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol, were linked with a higher risk of heart disease, as expected. Omega-3s from food helped. Omega-6s appeared to help.

What do the researchers say about the findings?

Nutritional guidelines on fats and heart health by such organizations as the American Heart Association may deserve another look, the study authors say.

The focus should move beyond just the fat content of food, Mozaffarian says. ""We can't judge the healthfulness of a food [only] by how many grams of saturated fat it has. We really should be moving toward a food-based analysis.

""It's not just the fat grams, and the type of food, but the way the food is processed,"" he says. For instance, the analysis found that a type of saturated fat linked with milk and dairy products reduced heart disease risk.

Based on the analysis, Mozaffarian and his colleagues say, the current heart health guidelines that promote eating more foods with omega-3s and omega-6s and less of those with saturated fats are not needed.

What do others say?

Other experts find fault with the study and its conclusions.

""Mainly I think the findings should be disregarded,"" says Walter Willett, MD, chair of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. While the analysis suggests that ''saturated fat is not quite as bad as its reputation, it depends on what you compare it to,"" he says.

""If you replace saturated fat with carbohydrates or refined starch or sugar, you are not changing your heart disease risk,"" he says. ''If you replace saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, you do get a reduction in heart disease risk.""

One analysis is not enough to change dietary advice, says James Blankenship, MD, director of cardiology at Geisinger Medical Center.

In the analysis, the researchers themselves cite a number of caveats and limitations, such as study participants self-reporting their fat intake.

In response to the study, the American Heart Association says its guidelines remain the same. For heart health, it recommends a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, nuts, and unsaturated fats.

Less than 6% of the diet should include saturated and trans fats, the association says.

Is there some common ground about how to protect heart health?

Yes.

Judging how heart-healthy a food is must take more than fat into account, Mozaffarian says. For instance, a lower-fat meat that is processed is not heart-healthy, he says.

Willett agrees. ""It's important to look at single nutrients, but also at whole food groups,"" he says. Blankenship offers these steps proven to benefit the heart:

Get regular exercise -- at least a half-hour a day.
Maintain a healthy body weight.
See your doctor and find out your heart disease risk. Know your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
""Don't spend so much time looking at food labels,"" Blankenship says. Instead, he says, go to the grocery store's produce department and load up.

If cholesterol and saturated fat don't play as large a role as we thought in heart disease, what's behind the heart disease problem?

Multiple factors, Blankenship says. They include obesity, genetics, sedentary lifestyles, diabetes, and high blood pressure. A poor diet drives risk, he says, ""but it's not the only thing.""

Mozaffarian reports receiving fees from Bunge, Pollock Institute, Quaker Oats, Life Sciences Research Organization, Foodminds, Nutrition Impact, Amarin, Astra Zeneca, Winston and Strawn LLP, and UpToDate, and serving on the scientific advisory board for Unilever North America.

2552,"President Trump has told multiple people, including EPA head Scott Pruitt, that he intends to pull the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, according to a new Axios report based on information from three anonymous sources with direct knowledge of the conversations. Earlier Saturday, Trump announced on Twitter that he would make a decision on the accord next week. Over the past three days, European leaders and even Pope Francis have lobbied Trump to support the agreement, but while leaders from the six other nations in the G7 signed a statement reaffirming their commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions on Saturday, Trump abstained. “The entire discussion about climate was very difficult, if not to say very unsatisfying,” announced German chancellor Angela Merkel, clearly frustrated with Trump’s indecision during the talks.

Axios adds that it’s possible Trump will impulsively change his mind, as Trump has done after telling people he would do something in the past; Axios also points out that all of Trump’s options for withdrawing from the deal would require as much as a year to carry through on, allowing for some additional uncertainty.

Speaking of uncertainty, in a Face the Nation interview set to air on CBS Sunday, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said that he was “quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord.” Speaking with the New York Times, Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, also made it sound as if Trump was still making up his mind after “a lot of give-and-take between the different countries” at the G7 summit. But according to Axios’s sources, Trump has already made his decision to ditch the pact, and that would definitely be consistent with his numerous past statements as one of the world’s most notorious deniers of the consensus scientific conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of global climate change. He also said during his presidential campaign that he would cancel the deal and has infamously and repeatedly called global warming a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese (and scientists) — but Trump says a lot of things and has, at least a few times, also hinted that he understood the threat of climate change.

President Obama helped negotiate the historic Paris Agreement in 2015, and it was officially ratified by the U.S. and 194 other signatories last year. Should Trump leave the pact, the U.S. would be the first country to exit, which would also be the second time that America has signed onto a global climate deal under a Democratic president only to walk away from the same agreement under a Republican predecessor, as President George W. Bush ultimately reneged on the Kyoto Protocol agreed to by President Bill Clinton in 1997.

America’s exit from the Paris Agreement wouldn’t invalidate the accord, which still has the support of most of the world, including China, and is likely to proceed without U.S. participation. But the failure of the U.S. to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions, being the world’s second-highest producer of such pollution, will worsen and likely accelerate an already dangerous problem. If other countries follow the U.S. out of the agreement, which remains a risk, that danger only multiplies."
2558,"A proposed secret communications back channel between Donald Trump's team and the Kremlin was reportedly intended to allow sensitive discussions about strategy in Syria, it was reported last night.

Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, was revealed to have proposed setting up the secret line in a meeting with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, at Trump Tower in December.

The back channel was intended to connect Michael Flynn, who was at the meeting and later became Mr Trump's first National Security Adviser, with Russian military leaders, the Associated Press reported. It came as the nascent Trump administration was developing its Syria policy before his inauguration. The communications would have used Russian diplomatic facilities and bypassed the US intelligence services.

Such a system was never established and after Rex Tillerson became Secretary of State the idea was reportedly dropped as Mr Trump's team decided to communicate with Moscow through more official channels.

The discussion of a back channel involving Mr Kushner was first revealed by the Washington Post late on Friday. US officials reportedly learned about it by monitoring Russian communications. Mr Kislyak was said to have been ""taken aback"" by Mr Kushner's proposal.

It also emerged Mr Kushner had at least three interactions, including two phone calls, with Mr Kislyak, during and after the election, that had not been previously disclosed. The discussions reportedly focused on fighting terrorism and improving US-Russian economic relations

Mr Kushner's lawyer Jamie Gorelick said: ""Mr Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings. He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.""

She said Mr Kushner could not remember any calls with Mr Kislyak before the election. She added: ""Mr Kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period.""

According to Reuters Mr Kushner also met Sergei Nikolaevich Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned bank Vnesheconombank and a trained intelligence officer appointed by Vladimir Purin, at Trump Tower in December. The bank is under US sanctions.

The White House declined to answer questions about Mr Kushner's meeting with Mr Kislyak.

But H.R. McMaster, who replaced Mr Flynn as National Security Adviser  said so-called ""back-channeling"" was completely normal. Asked if it would concern him if someone in the Trump administration tried to set up a back channel with the Russian embassy or the Kremlin, he replied: ""No"".

He said: ""We have back-channel communications with any number of individual countries. What that allows you to do is communicate in a discreet manner.""

Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee which is investigating any links between the Trump campaign and Russia, asked the campaign to produce all Russia-related documents, including phone records and emails, dating back to its official start in June 2015."
