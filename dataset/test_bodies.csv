2,"A bereaved Afghan mother took revenge on the Taliban after watching them kill her son in an ambush. Reza Gul killed 25 Taliban fighters and injured five others in a seven-hour gunbattle in Farah province.

Gul, who was joined by her daughter and daughter in-law, engaged the Taliban using AK-47s and grenades, despitenever before having used a weapon.

The embattled mother told Tolo news, a 24-hour Afghan news broadcaster, she was awakened by shots early Tuesday. After seeing that her son had been killed, Gul and the other two women fought back.

“I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon,” Gul told Tolo News. “I went to the check post and began shooting back.”

Seema, her daughter-in-law, added: “The fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons. We were committed to fight until the last bullet.”

Gul said that the battlefield was covered in Talib fighters after the deadly exchange ended.

While the Taliban have not publicly commented on the incident, the Afghan government labeled it a symbol of a public uprising against the Taliban.

Taliban and other groups have regained large swathes of the country as U.S. and NATO forces slowly pull out troops after 14 years of war. The Taliban have targeted government and foreign infrastructure as the group attempts to claw back power it lost in 2001.

While the Taliban have made key gains in rural regions, members continue to employ suicide bomber tactics in well protected towns and cities. Earlier this week, 50 people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated a vest during a volleyball competition in Yahyakahil, Paktika province.

That particular attack prompted President Ashraf Ghani to order a complete overview of the country’s defense forces and to rethink the ban on nighttime raids, which were outlawed by his predecessor, Hamid Karzai."
6,"Posting photos of a gun-toting child online, ISIS supporters announced that the group’s youngest soldier has died in combat.

Twitter accounts linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham claimed that the child soldier “got martyred” with his father while fighting for the terrorist group in Syria.

Photos posted on Twitter showed the smiling boy in military fatigues holding weapons that, at times, are almost as large as his body. British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.

The photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.
In the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag “shibal_alBaghdadi” — which translates as “the cub of Baghdadi” — on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.

While ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliph.

Mr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem “more brutal than it is,” the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.

ISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.

“It seems like a very legitimate thing,” Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. “I would vouch for it.”

A United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.
Children are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in “uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,” the UN reported.

“Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,” said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.

“If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, we’re going to see this face to face,” she said.

Currently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground."
7,"At least 25 suspected Boko Haram insurgents were killed in clashes between soldiers and the Islamist militants in northeast Nigeria and five civilians were killed in fighting elsewhere in the region, a military source and residents said on Monday.

A ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the militants six months ago, and talks were due to continue in neighbouring Chad on Monday.

Boko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least six attacks over the weekend – blamed by security sources on the insurgents – that have killed several dozen people since the announcement of the ceasefire.

A government spokesman has said that the fighting on Sunday may be the work of criminal gangs in the lawless region.

An army officer, who requested anonymity, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but soldiers fought them off. “Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,” the officer said.

He said an armoured vehicle and some arms were recovered from the insurgents.

Damboa, a garrison town near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.

A member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, “Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.”

Separately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.

Tada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.

“My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,” he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.

“They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain. When the insurgents sighted our people, they pursued them and slaughtered five,” Tada said."

Word has it that Amazon is looking to launch an ad-supported streaming video service, which could give rivals a run for their money. The online retail giant is planning to roll out the new service early next year, the New York Post reported on Friday. It would be separate from Amazon's $99 yearly Prime membership, which offers unlimited movie streaming from the Instant Video library.
In a statement, an Amazon spokeswoman neither confirmed nor denied the rumor.
""We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers,"" the spokeswoman said. ""We're often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers, but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.""
This isn't the first time we've heard this rumor. The Wall Street Journal in March reported that Amazon was planning to launch its own advertising-filled TV streaming service — free to users, of course. Amazon, however, quickly shot down that rumor.
""We're often experimenting with new things, but we have no plans to offer a free streaming-media service,"" an Amazon spokesperson said at the time.

But the Post's sources now say an ad-supported version is definitely happening. But oddly, the report suggests that it might not be free. One source speculated that Amazon may undercut Netflix's current monthly price of $7.99, though.
""The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn't want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,"" a source told the news outlet.
Meanwhile, Amazon is already gaining ground on streaming rivals. A recent Sandvine study found that Amazon Instant Video has established itself as the second largest paid streaming video service in North America, though Netflix still dominates.
Netflix accounted for 34.9 percent of downstream North American traffic in the peak evening hours this year. Amazon had only 2.6 percent of downstream traffic, but its share has more than doubled in the past 18 months, Sandvine said.
On other news, Amazon is also mulling its own travel service, which would let you book stays at independent hotels and resorts, according to a report from travel news site Skift. The so-called Amazon Travel site, set to launch around Jan. 1, would reportedly ""feature a curated selection of hotels within a few hours' drive from New York, Los Angeles, and Seattle.""
Amazon declined to comment about the travel site rumor.

17,"An article saying NASA confirmed six days of “total darkness” in December is fake and it’s merely an iteration of an old Internet hoax.

Essentially every year, there’s bogus rumors saying that there will be three days of darkness in December, but they’ve obviously proven not to be true.

They seem to reference the Three Days of Darkness mentioned by Catholic prophets.

However, a “satirical” and entertainment website, Huzlers.com, posted an article about six days of darkness. It uses fake quotes from a NASA official.

“WORLDWIDE – NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 6 days of almost complete darkness and will happen from the dates Tuesday the 16 – Monday the 22 in December. The world will remain, during these three days, without sunlight due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight,” it reads in part.

But Huzlers has a disclaimer that says it’s not real and shouldn’t ever be taken seriously.

“Huzlers.com is a combination of real shocking news and satirical entertainment to keep its visitors in a state of disbelier,” the About Us section reads on the bottom of each web page.

The bogus NASA article had tens of thousands of shares and “likes” on Saturday.

According to Snopes.com, similar rumors have been going on for a while and have taken on different forms.

“No, the universe is not about to realign in December 2014, nor will there be a three-day blackout at that time during which the Earth will shift into a new dimension. Neither NASA nor any other credible scientific entity has made such a pronouncement. Ever,” the site says. “This item originated back in 2012, when interest in the belief that the Mayan calendar would end on 21 December 2012 (thus foretelling the end of the world as we know it) was running high, and it has simply been updated and recirculated with the year 2014 replacing the original references to 2012.”"
22,"HBO's subscription streaming service will be called HBO Now and is expected to cost $15 per month, according to the International Business Times. The report says that HBO is targeting a launch for Now in early April, ahead of the start date for Game of Thrones. While Game of Thrones would be a great way for HBO to drive subscriptions to the new service, it'll have to be careful if it plans to do that: last year, HBO's online streaming option for cable subscribers, HBO Go, wouldn't work for many who were trying to watch during the premiere. That would be a very bad look for a new service, and the Times says that HBO doesn't plan on launching until it's satisfied that it can do so without issue.

$15/MONTH WOULD MAKE HBO'S SERVICE NEARLY TWICE THE COST OF NETFLIX

Apple is reportedly one of the partners that HBO could launch its new service with. According to the Times, Apple has been aggressive in its attempts to secure a place as one of HBO's launch partners. If a deal is made, Apple TV users would be able to access and stream HBO Now, potentially through a standalone app. Apple has been adding more and more channels to the Apple TV over the last couple years, and the addition of HBO's subscription streaming service would make its device all the more appealing. The Times notes that HBO's parent company wants to see this service be accessible on platforms like the Roku, Xbox, and PlayStation as well, but it's not clear if discussions are ongoing. Nonetheless, it seems likely that HBO would want to work with multiple major partners to get this service out there.

It's still not known what HBO's subscription streaming service will actually offer. Though many will hope for the same access that HBO Go receives — that is, all of HBO's original content and the movies it's currently playing — it's possible that won't be the case. HBO may want to position this service as something distinctly different from its cable service as a way to prevent subscribers from moving online. On the other hand, the $15 per month fee may mean that HBO is earning about as much regardless of how you subscribe. That price would make it tougher to compete with Netflix, but HBO hasn't exactly had trouble finding people willing to pay subscription fees that high in the past. With the even wider audience that this service will open it up to, HBO may not be that worried."

48,"The interwebs was all aflutter today with news that elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London’s Metropolitan Police. According to reports, after hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed. A video was even produced purporting to reveal Banksy’s real identity:



According to reports:

“…The City of London Police say Banksy’s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run. “We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky’s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,” Edwards said.”

(ABOVE: A mugshot CLAIMING to have been taken by London Police today of Paul Horner AKA Banksy.)


 

“We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.” Edwards continued, “Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.”

(ABOVE: According to reports, this is a photo of Banksy, AKA Paul Horner, seen here being taken into police custody.)

Despite the “if it’s on the internet, it must be true” adage, we immediately smelled HOAX, so did a bit of digging (our mascot Fido is good at that).  It didn’t take long (30 seconds in fact), to rule this out as a not-very-elaborate fake.  We reached out to Banksy’s PR agent Jo Brooks, who confirmed the hoax in 3 simple words:

Banksy’s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.

So we can all breath a big sigh of relief… inhale, exhale… Banksy is still a mystery. Someone. Somewhere. Phew."
66,"THE Islamic State may be harvesting the organs of victims to finance its terror operations, Iraq’s ambassador to the United Nations says.

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim said today that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.

“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” he said, referring to the UN Security Council.

“It is clear they are missing certain parts.”

HOSTAGE: Kayla Mueller’s boyfriend tried to save her from ISIS

Ambassador Alhakim also said a dozen doctors had been “executed” in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting, before briefing the council on the situation in Iraq, in which he accused ISIS of committing “crimes of genocide” in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing UN envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.

Mr Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that “it’s very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day.”

He said Iraq’s most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State group has seized in the past year, including a third of both Iraq and neighbouring Syria, where the Sunni militants have imposed strict Sharia law.

“Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,” Mr Mladenov said.

ISIS had recently confirmed the death of American aid worker and ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller, who was kidnapped by the militant group in 2013 during what should have been a 10-minute trip to the bus station in Syria.

Ms Mueller, her boyfriend at the time, Alkhani, the taxi driver and a fourth person were ambushed and forced out of the vehicle at gunpoint and threatened with death.

Mueller remained a hostage, while Alkhani was released a couple of months later after being beaten and interrogated about his work as a photographer, his religion and his relationship to Mueller.

The terror group has also recently antagonised Egypt after releasing a video showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians.

In the state of Colorado, marijuana dispensaries are big business – earning some retailers nearly $1 million per year.

Those numbers were so appealing to the KFC Corporation, they decided to incorporate a marijuana dispensary with their Colorado franchise restaurants.

Franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee.


 
The KFC Corporation was approved on February 3, 2015 for their Marijuana Retail Recreational Pot / Medical Marijuana Occupational Business License.

Currently, 42 of the nearly 100 KFC franchises in the state of Colorado have added this “option” to their menu.

 fc,550x550,white.u1“In order to be successful, a deep understanding of the market is critical to success,” says KFC spokesperson William Rausch. “It’s all about evolution and we are ready to serve the needs of the people of Colorado.”

 

 

Marijuana may be purchased only by adults 21 years or older, and a picture ID is required.

Coloradans may buy 1 ounce at a time, while out-of-state residents are limited to a quarter ounce.

Due to banking restrictions, all sales are required to be cash transactions. Prices begin around $200 and up per ounce along with a 25% marijuana tax.

Argentina's President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner just took on Iair Tawil as a godson. True.
Thing is, Iair is a 21-year-old son of a rabbi, and now, Argentina's first Jewish presidential godson, even though he's not a baby and is at no risk of becoming a lycanthrope.
Apparently several news agencies, which we won't be making fun of for reporting something so ridiculous, claimed that the president adopted a baby to keep it from becoming a werewolf.
In Argentina, the legend of the lobizón is similar to the standard werewolf legend. Basically, in the Argentinian legend, the seventh son of a seventh son was suuuuuper susceptible to becoming a werewolf.
What's funny is this apparently has nothing to do with the Argentinian tradition of the seventh son (or daughter) of a family being eligible to become the President's godchild. That tradition was apparently brought over by Russian immigrants in 1907.
President Fernández is already godmother to around 700 children after taking office in 2007.
Regardless, it's still pretty cute this 21-year-old man became her godson!
We love they're all lighting a menorah too, seeing as how only Christian babies used to be eligible to become presidential godchildren!
We're glad times are changing! And REALLY glad werewolves don't exist. LOLz!"

Neurosurgeons had removed the top part of her skull and were in the process of taking out parts of the growth when suddenly she woke up.

Iga Jasica, 19, was undergoing brain surgery in a hospital in Katowice, southwest Poland, when she suddenly came round and began speaking

But instead of panicking or crying out in pain, Miss Jasica began calmly talking to doctors and asked how her operation was going.

Medics say she was unable to see or feel anything that was happening to her, but for some reason had regained consciousness and the ability to speak.

Doctors say it is possible that the brain surgery caused neurons to trigger which could have woken Miss Jesica up, but investigators are probing whether the anesthetic was administered incorrectly.

Despite having part of her skull removed and her brain exposed, Miss Jasica began talking to doctors about how her operation was going, and cats - her favourite animal

Medics added that it was extremely unusual for a patient to come round during surgery, especially while their brain was exposed.

After the operation Miss Jasica said: 'I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love.

150,"""My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say 'that’s fucked up' and fix it. Fix society. Please.""

UNION TOWNSHIP, Ohio — A 17-year-old transgender teen was struck and killed by a passing semi trailer on an Ohio interstate on Sunday, and a previously written suicide note later appeared on the teen’s Tumblr blog through scheduled publishing.

Leelah Alcorn was in the roadway when she was struck, and is believed to have walked 3-4 miles from her parents house in nearby Kings Mill, Ohio.

Police say she died at 2:20 a.m. Sunday.

The incident is being investigated by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, but local media have reported the incident as the death of a teen “boy,” using Leelah’s (male) birth name, and have made no mention that she was transgender.

Following the incident, this entry appeared on Leelah’s blog describing the pain of being “a girl trapped in a boy’s body” and her Christian parents’ refusal to allow her to transition:

SUICIDE NOTE

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in… because I’m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally “boyish” things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

I formed a sort of a “fuck you” attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted.

So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I’m surprised I didn’t kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent’s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness.

At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually they realized they didn’t actually give a shit about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week.

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s fucked up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.

Goodbye,

Conal says his trouble started with a few erratic charges: Bills sometimes didn't show up, and he was charged for equipment that was never activated, or that he didn't actually have. Customer service reps promised the problems would be resolved. Instead, things got significantly more hellish in October of last year.

According to Conal, Comcast sent him nearly $2,000 of equipment he'd never ordered and didn't want, and tried to bill him for it anyway.

But, as an accountant by trade, he had no problem documenting every billing error and overcharge, and he brought them in as a spreadsheet when he dropped off the unwanted DVRs, modems, and other equipment.

Even then, Conal says, he wasn't able to get his money back. Instead, Comcast sent him to collections in February.

And this is where Conal made the call that allegedly cost him his job. Per Consumerist:

On Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast's customer service, which hadn't been of any help in the year he'd been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company's Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.

He describes that callback as ""bizarre,"" with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with ""How can I help you?"" Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn't specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.

So he tried the Controller's office again, to let them know that the rep they'd sent his way had failed miserably at her job.

Considering that even Comcast acknowledges its customer service experience is so broken that it could take years to reform, you can hardly blame a customer who understands corporate structures for escalating his complaint.

Comcast did blame Conal, though. Consumerist again:

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal's subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he'd only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

The creepiest part is that, although he was allegedly fired for throwing around the name of his powerful employer—who, surprise, happens to do business with Comcast—Conal swears he never told anyone at Comcast where he worked. He believes they just went the extra mile to look him up online and contact his company—because Comcast cares.

Comcast has confirmed at least one part of the story: In a letter to Conal's lawyer, who is considering filing suit against the cable provider, Comcast's lawyer said the company did contact Conal's job.

Comcast's counsel says the ex-customer ""is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn"" about his customer service struggle.

It seems that arguing with you on the phone for 20 minutes or trying to talk you into paying fees you know are fradulent is nowhere near the worst thing Comcast can inflict on you, the customer.

They can apparently also wreck your life in ways that have nothing to do with your cable or internet services.

Really looking forward to Comcast becoming basically the only cable provider in America!

167,"LAS VEGAS -- The person behind the $300,000 dinner at Bellagio’s Prime Steakhouse has been revealed.

Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Vice Media Inc. CEO Shane Smith sprung for the dinner following a lucky run at the casino’s blackjack tables. Bloomberg said its source was a person who asked not to be identified because the meal was private.

On Tuesday, MGM Resorts International Chairman Jim Murren cited the dinner bill as an “encouraging sign” that Las Vegas visitors were eager to spend money again. He said the dinner was for a party of more than a dozen people at the upscale Prime and included wine with a price tag upward of $15,000 per bottle.

A guest at the dinner, who asked not to be identified, told Bloomberg the dinner party was closer to 25.

Murren said he hadn’t seen a check like that since 2007.

Bloomberg termed Brooklyn-based Vice a media titan that “has grown from a free, whiskey-stained Montreal monthly.” Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks each invested $250 million for 10 percent stakes in the company last year.

Smith is 45 and, according to Gawker, gave $1 million to Vice’s staff at last year’s holiday party.

David Carr, the New York Times media columnist, wrote last month on Twitter, weeks before his death at 58, “No brainer quiz. What media co exec did I watch win $100k at blackjack last nite? Hint: gambling not his only vice.”"
174,"Saudi Arabia's national airline plans to keep men and women apart after passengers objected to on-board gender mixing, the Emirates247 news website reported Wednesday.

""There are solutions to this problem,"" said Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, the assistant manager of national carrier Saudia. ""We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,"" Saudi daily Ajel quoted him as saying.

The paper said flight staff at Saudi Arabia's airports would be instructed to keep men and women segregated on board Saudia planes, unless they are close relatives.

Complaints about mixed-gender sitting are also common on planes flying to Israel, with some ultra-Orthodox Jewish men refusing to sit next to unrelated women and some women objecting to being asked to move so that the men won't have to sit next to them.

A Delta flight from New York to Israel was delayed earlier this month when ultra-Orthodox passengers refused to sit between two women, Israel Radio reported on Friday.

A number of similar incidents were reported in the media earlier this year, bringing the controversial issue into the headlines. In some cases, the men reportedly offered to pay the female passengers to switch their seats.

In September, a petition on Change.org urged Israeli carrier El Al to stop allowing female passengers to be ""bullied, harassed, and intimidated into switching seats."" El Al told Haaretz that its policy is ""to try to accommodate any customer request.”"
181,"While Apple announced that the base model of its forthcoming smartwatch would cost $350, it's remained tight-lipped about the pricing of the rest of the range. Now, a new report suggests that the stainless steel version will start at $500, and the gold at somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000.

The report comes from sources at Apple via French website iGen.fr. As MacRumors points out, the site has been reliable in the past, accurately reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

It's thought that the $350 price applies to the aluminum model of the watch. Certainly, $500 for the stainless steel version feels about right by comparison. The cost of the gold model, though; well, quite simply it depends on how much gold there is. We'll have to wait to find out, but such high pricing would indeed make it very much a luxury item.

The iGen.fr sources also claim that Apple is hoping to release the watch as soon as possible—though other rumors claim we may have to wait until Spring of 2015. Either way, we have longer to wait before we find out more than we'd like. [iGen.fr via MacRumors]"
191,"A heartwarming letter of support written by a nine-year-old to her primary school teacher has swept the internet.

The British student wrote the tearjerker note after the teacher told her class that he was gay.

The man, who has preferred to stay anonymous, told the website PinkNews that he decided to come out to his pupils after learning that all of the class had heard the word 'gay' used as an insult.

The note that a British student wrote to her teacher after he told her class that he was gay. The man came out after learning every pupil had heard 'gay' used as an insult

He was stunned to receive the letter from the child afterwards, which described him as 'fantastic and awesome.'

It read in full: 'Dear Mr R

'Even though you're gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now.

'I still think about you the same way as I used to.

'You're a great teacher and these are just some of the words that I would describe you as: great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.

'The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave.

'You don't have to feel scared because I know that everyone in the class feels the same way as I do.

'From A x x

'PS. We are all proud of you'

The teacher then shared the letter on social media.

He told PinkNews: 'As a primary school teacher, I'd always worried about mentioning my sexuality, despite the fact that my colleagues talked about their husbands, wives and significant others all the time.

'Then, as part of anti-bullying week, I'd asked who'd heard 'gay' being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned.'

The teacher, who preferred to stay anonymous, said that he welled up after reading the letter (picture posed by models)

He continued: 'Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.

'After speaking to my Head, who was very supportive, we agreed I could tell the class that I'm gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they're talking about me.'

'The reaction was fantastic – there were a lot of gasps and shocked looks and some basic questions – do you have a boyfriend, etc – but after a couple of minutes they were over it and we moved on to the rest of the lesson.

'The letter came a couple of days later. The little girl who wrote it gave it to me at the start of the day with all the other slips about dinner money, school trips and doctors appointments.

'Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson, 'It's just your life'. Then she went back to her maths.

'For my class it was a surprise sure but, to them, it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgement, no follow-up, just acceptance.

'Now, I can mention my fiance as easily as any other teacher and my class know me a little better. I've had a lot of letters and cards over the years, but this one I know I'll keep forever.'"

204,"Seven girls, ages 13 to 15, are pregnant after a five-day school trip to their country’s capital city and their parents are being blamed.

The schoolgirls, from the city of Banja Luka, went to the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital, Sarajevo.

Nenad Babici, the national coordinator for reproductive health of the republic, told Inserbia.info that it was discovered that the seven schoolgirls got pregnant on the school trip.

The school in Banja Luka had taken 28 girls to the nation’s capital city for a five-day trip to visit museums and historic sights in the city, ranked among the finest in the world.

Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision, reported the Daily Mail.

However, Babici blamed parents for not educating their children properly.

He said that early sexual relations later lead to adverse consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a Sarajevo gynecologist, said a growing trend of underage pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina is worrying.

“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he told Inserbia.info.

Educational institutes and parents, he said, should play a stronger role in providing effective sex education.

“It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education, so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.

“We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.”

220,"FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts -

Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was the victim of an “unfortunate accident” yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just weeks after his high-profile trial began, according to warden Paul Jacobson.

Corrections officers reportedly found the alleged terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.

“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”

“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”

“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence,” said warden Jacobson. “Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev were both suspected of perpetrating the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013. The bombings killed three people and reportedly injured as many as 264 others. Shortly after the FBI named the two suspects and released images of them, the two brothers reportedly killed an MIT police officer and carjacked an SUV in a shootout with police. During the shootout, the elder brother, Tamerlan was captured but was killed when his brother drove over him with the SUV. On the evening of April 20, 2013, the wounded Dzhokhar was found unarmed and hiding in a boat on a trailer in Watertown, Massachusetts.

On January 30, 2014, United States Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the federal government would seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev. The trial had just begun on January 5, 2015, as Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him."
226,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. airstrikes earlier this week killed the leader of the al-Shabab terrorist group in Somalia, the Pentagon said Friday. President Barack Obama said the death of Ahmed Abdi Godane demonstrated U.S. counterterrorism resolve and was an example of his deliberate approach to dismantling al-Qaida affiliated groups.

The Pentagon's press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, announced the death in a brief written statement. It took the Pentagon four days to conclusively determine that Godane had not survived Monday's airstrikes.

Al-Shabab has not publicly confirmed Godane's death.

Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud urged al-Shabab militants to renounce violence, saying they have an opportunity to embrace peace following Godane's death.

""While an extreme hardcore may fight over the leadership of al-Shabab, this is a chance for the majority of members of al-Shabab to change course and reject Godane's decision to make them the pawns of an international terror campaign,"" he said in a statement.

The Somali president said the U.S. operation was carried out ""with the full knowledge and agreement of"" his government and that Somalis ""greatly value the support of our international allies"" in the fight against al-Shabab.

Obama, speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Newport, Wales, told reporters the success against al-Shabab should leave no doubt about his determination to degrade and eventually destroy the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. military announced later Friday that a mix of fighter jets, drones, attack planes and bombers launched four airstrikes Thursday and Friday in northern Iraq, destroying a host of Islamic State targets including an observation post, an armed vehicle and three mortar positions.

Obama faces mounting pressure to take more aggressive military action against the Islamic State, which evolved from an al-Qaida affiliate that sprouted in Iraq in 2004.

""We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kinds of organizations"" that threaten U.S. personnel and the homeland, Obama said. ""That deliberation allows us to do it right, but have no doubt: We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people.""

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

The State Department declared al-Shabab a terrorist organization in February 2008. The implications of the group's loss of Godane are unclear.

""The individual who takes his place will live in fear,"" said Army Col. Steven Warren, a Pentagon spokesman.

Because Godane had weakened and effectively dismantled the al-Shabab council of leaders known as the shura, a meeting of regional commanders will have to take place to pick his successor, said Matt Bryden, the head of Sahan Research in Nairobi, Kenya. Bryden predicted the meeting will be difficult and dangerous to organize.

Terrorism analyst J.M. Berger predicted a significant splintering between al-Shabab's domestically focused insurgents and internationally aspiring terrorists.

Abdi Aynte, a Somali analyst who runs a Mogadishu-based think tank called the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies, predicted that Godane's death ""will almost certainly be the beginning of the end of the organization.""

Under Godane's leadership, he said, al-Shabab had gradually become a guerrilla movement that avoided conventional warfare, tactics that suited it amid mounting military pressure from African Union troops and government forces.

Godane, who was born in 1977 and raised in the town of Hargeisa in the autonomous region of Somaliland, was said to be a quiet boy who was interested in the Quran and Islamic studies in his early years. His relatives there described him as ""a private man"" who was devoted to Islamic teachings at mosques, said Mohamed Hassan, a former senior Somali intelligence official in Somaliland who once was tasked with tracking down Godane over charges the future terror leader stole money when he worked for a local telecommunications company. In Somaliland, he also had been accused of involvement in the murder of foreigners.

Godane is believed to have settled in Mogadishu in 2004, working at local charities before he joined the Islamic Courts Union, al-Shabab's precursor group that once controlled Mogadishu and many parts of Somalia before it was ousted by Ethiopian forces.

237,"A woman cut off her three-year-old nephew’s penis after flying into a rage because he walked in on her using the toilet.

Xue Paan, 37, now faces jail time following her sadistic punishment of her nephew Qiang Qiang, who she was looking after while his mother visited a neighbour in the Henan Province in central China.

Xue was reportedly using her phone on the toilet when the toddler walked in and asked if he could play a game on the device.

She was so angered by this that she took a blunt kitchen knife and cut his penis off with it, then fled the house before her sister, Qiang’s mother, returned.

Mother Cai Tuan, 27, immediately ran back to the house after hearing her child scream.

‘Qiang Qiang had fainted and was lying in a pool of blood. Next to him was a knife and his penis. It was simply horrific,’ she said.

The boy’s parents rushed him to a hospital where surgeons were able to reattach the appendage, before transporting him to a specialist clinic in Beijing.

A hospital spokesman said the knife was ‘quite blunt and the cut wasn’t clean so although we reattached the boy’s penis, it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment’.

Following three surgeries in total, hospital workers are now confident the young boy’s penis will work properly and he should suffer only minor side effects from the attack.

His aunt was tracked down and arrested, and police say she now faces five years in prison for the horrific attack.

A message posted through Rosenberg's Facebook account Monday  Gill Rosenberg's Facebook profile

International Business Times was unable to verify that Rosenberg herself was responsible for the post.

Rosenberg, 31, who migrated to Israel from Canada in 2006, is believed to have served for two years in the Israeli military, according to a report by Haaretz. She had earlier claimed, through photos published on the same account, that she had joined Kurdish forces battling ISIS in Iraqi Kurdistan in the country’s north.

Jihadists believed to be loyal to ISIS had claimed on Sunday that Rosenberg, along with a number of female fighters, had been abducted near Kobani and that the Israeli military was deliberately trying to curb the news of her capture. However, a number of media outlets subsequently raised doubts over the claims, citing Kurdish sources, who said that Rosenberg was nowhere near Kobani.

""This is false propaganda by IS,” Kurdish sources told The Times of Israel. ""We can say with a high level of certainty that no Israeli volunteer, or any international volunteer for that matter, arrived to fight in the city of Kobani in Syria.""

The Israeli government, which on Sunday said it was investigating reports of her capture, had also stressed that the information was of “dubious credibility,” according to a report by The Times of Israel. “I cannot confirm that [report of Rosenberg’s capture] and I hope that it isn’t true,” Israel’s Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon had reportedly said."
286,"A rumor on Tuesday claims Apple's upcoming Apple Watch will be priced at $500 for the mid-tier steel model and up to $5,000 for top-end gold ""Edition"" versions, a number much higher than previous estimates.

Citing an unnamed source, French website iGen reports Apple is looking to field the Apple Watch at a proposed retail cost of $500 for versions with stainless steel cases and between $4,000 and $5,000 for Apple Watch Edition models. This leaves the Apple Watch Sport version as Apple's lowest-priced option, which the company said would come in at $350.

While the website has been accurate in predicting recent Apple product launches, the claims are unverifiable and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Previous estimates from jewelers and industry analysts pegged high-end Apple Watch Edition models at $1,200. Edition versions are crafted from 18-karat gold, feature sapphire crystal and come with a variety of luxurious strap options. Apple has not commented on whether the entire chassis is solid gold, or merely gold plated, but the company apparently developed a variant of the metal twice as strong as the standard.

Additionally, the source claims Apple is still shooting for a launch on Valentine's Day.

Prior to the Apple Watch announcement, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo accurately predicted that the device would come in two sizes and multiple models spread across a wide range of price points. At the time, he speculated the wearable could cost into the ""thousands of dollars.""

Apple announced its anticipated first foray into the wearables market in September, saying only that pricing would start at $350. Given that the Apple Watch Sport is made from relatively low-cost materials — aluminum, elastomer band and non-sapphire window — many believe it to be the entry-level model."

295,"Led Zeppelin fans will be disappointed to learn that there’s no reunion tour and a story that appeared in the Daily Mirror suggesting that Robert Plant ripped up an $800 contract for such a gig is false, according to the Guardian.

The reported tour was supposedly financed by Virgin founder Richard Branson, who wanted to turn one of his Virgin planes into a new iteration of “The Starship,” the jet​ the band used to tour in the 1970s. The group was to play 35 dates in three locales-- London, Berlin and New Jersey.

Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones had signed on. And the late drummer John Bonham’s son Jason was to play drums for the band. “It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,” a source told the Daily Mirror. “When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

Turns out, the entire tale is “rubbish,” said Plant’s publicist to the Guardian, backing up what Page had said to the publication in September - a Zeppelin reunion was “[not] very likely.”"
308,"Nigeria said on Friday it had agreed a ceasefire with Islamist militants Boko Haram and reached a deal for the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the group six months ago.

There was no immediate confirmation from the rebels, who have brought five years of havoc in Africa’s top oil producer and triggered an international outcry by seizing the girls from the northeast town of Chibok in April.

“I wish to inform this audience that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded,” said the head of Nigeria’s military, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, adding the deal had followed three days of talks with the militant sect.

Government spokesman Mike Omeri said the deal covered the release of the captives and Boko Haram had given assurances “that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well.”

Their release would be a huge boost for President Goodluck Jonathan, who faces an election next year and has been pilloried at home and abroad for his slow response to the kidnapping and his inability to quell the violence, the biggest security threat to Africa’s biggest economy.

Apart from one appearance on a Boko Haram video, the girls have not been seen since the brazen nighttime raid on the town near the Cameroon border, although police and a parent said last month that one of the victims had been released.

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as “Western education is sinful,” has killed thousands of people in its fight to create an Islamic caliphate in the vast scrubland of Nigeria’s impoverished northeast.

A senior Nigerian security source confirmed the existence of talks, but said it remained unclear whether Abuja was negotiating with self-proclaimed movement leader Abubakar Shekau, or another faction within the group.

“Commitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine. It is worth taking seriously,” the security source told Reuters.

Several rounds of negotiations have been attempted in recent years but they have never achieved a peace deal, partly because the group is believed to be deeply divided.

“There are some talks but it depends on the buy-in of the whole group. I would be surprised if Shekau had suddenly changed his mind and is ready for a ceasefire,” the source added.

The government was negotiating with Danladi Ahmadu, a man calling himself the secretary-general of Boko Haram, a presidency source said. It was not clear if Ahmadu is part of the same faction as Shekau.

Security sources in neighbouring Chad said Chadian mediators had been involved in the discussions, which were part of a larger deal that led to the release a week ago of 27 hostages, including 10 Chinese workers, kidnapped in Cameroon.

Separately, Cameroon’s defence ministry said eight soldiers and 107 Boko Haram militants had been killed in fighting in the far north on Wednesday and Thursday, a region that has suffered regular cross-border raids."

315,"A “tempting eyes” ban has just been announced in Saudi Arabia that further represses women more than they already are. In this part of the world, women are known to cover their bodies completely from head-to-toe. The eyes are one of the only parts of their body that are seen in public.

Opposing Views reports that women who have eyes “with a nice shape and makeup” could be deemed too tempting to other men, and police can make them wear veils. Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice announced this decision a few days ago. It’s one bound to get universal criticism.

Assyrian International News Agency covered what the Saudi Arabian committee’s spokesman has to say about the new law. Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, explains that Saudi police “have a right” to make a woman cover her eyes.

“The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones. We have the right to do so.”

This development has sparked the question of what defines “tempting eyes” and how will women be evaluated on having them? An unidentified journalist in the nation best describes what Saudi police are going after.

“Uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.”

He adds that a lot of people in Saudi Arabia will be very upset about the law. This type of control will outrage citizens of the country, the unnamed journalist says.

“It’s so stupid. I don’t know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won’t be silent.”

The report notes that no divide between Church and State exists in Saudi Arabia. The bad part is that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has powerful “backers” that include Prince Naif, the heir to the nation’s throne. He announced that the committee “should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.”

If there was any hope among the people that King Abdullah’s son would steer Saudi Arabia in a different direction, it’s lost at this point. By supporting the committee, the prince also supports the “tempting eye ban.” Oppression will continue in the nation, as women are considered nothing more than property.

322,"LOS ANGELES, California ( The Adobo Chronicles) – He did it again. Rapper Kanye West reprised his most infamous stunt at Sunday night’s Grammy awards, taking the stage as Beck was accepting the album of the year award. West popped up on stage and moved toward Beck as if he was about to take the trophy from him. Instead, West turned away and quickly jumped down.

Beck beat out both the night’s top winner, Sam Smith, and the category’s expected winner, Beyoncé.

The incident was a repeat of the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when West accosted Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech after Swift’s “You Belong With Me” beat Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” for Female Video of the Year.

“Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’ma let you finish,” West said after taking the microphone at Radio City Music Hall, “but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!”

West was roundly criticized for his action and was even called a “jackass” by no less than President Obama.

After this latest incident, organizers of the major awards shows like the Grammys, MTV Video Music Awards, People’s Choice Awards and the Oscars have unanimously agreed to disinvite and bar West from their respective ceremonies. The television networks that air these awards programs also joined in the ‘West boycott.’

No more Kanye West on live TV! And Beyoncé just lost her most loyal cheerleader."
338,"Tonight's Australian Open coverage on ESPN2 featured announcer Chris Fowler explaining to the audience that Japanese pro Kei Nishikori is, among other things, the highest-paid tennis player in the world and the owner of a restaurant chain, a soccer team, and clothing and perfume lines. None of those things are true, and they all come from notorious satire site MediaMass.

Fowler cited Nishikori as having earned $46 million in 2014. The actual number is $11 million, according to Forbes. That makes him the ninth-highest paid player—not the richest.

That's okay, Chris. It happens to the best of us."
344,"While child entrepreneurs have become increasingly common in the last decade, not many hit the lofty heights that 17-year-old “teen wolf” Mohammed Islam reached when his trading earnings reached the “high eight figures.”

As the New York Post reports, Islam, a teenager from Queens, still lives at home with his parents, but has been trading on the stock exchange on his lunch breaks at Stuyvesant High School. The Teen Wolf is the son of immigrants from Bengal in South Asia. Mohammed trades with two other friends, and they hope to start a hedge fund when the Teen Wolf turns 18 and graduates from high school.

Islam started with penny stocks at the unbelievable age of 9. When most kids are in the fourth grade, they’re learning to play sports, and figuring out fractions. Mohammed was putting his tutoring earnings to work. As often happens on the stock exchange, Islam lost his initial investment. He describes the event as “paralyzing,” and swore off the market thinking he just didn’t have the required nerves of steel.

Bengal region of Asia

Perhaps to better understand the losses that crippled him, Islam turned to studying modern finance, and became enthralled with Paul Tudor Jones. Jones is a billionaire from Connecticut who manages hedge funds and private assets. As is often the case, much of Jones’ success came on the heels of failure. Thousands and thousands of dollars lost, over and over, but Jones kept coming back for more, and ultimately captured overwhelming success. That fortitude, paired with his positive outlook, inspired Mohammed to give the game another try. And like the man who inspired him, Mohammed Islam has become a resounding success in his own right.

The Teen Wolf moniker is a reference to Leonardo DiCaprio’s portrayal of Jordan Belfort — called the “wolf of Wall Street,” another young trader who had an uncanny ability to make money on the stock exchanges. Islam and his trading buddies intend to become billionaires by next year.

“What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”

But according to Mohammed Islam and his friends, it’s not just about the money.

“We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.”

The Post reported that despite his resounding success, Islam is shy and modest, and only gave a rough estimate of his earnings. While he has a very bright future, and grand dreams for his journey into it, for now he has to content himself with expensive meals at Morimoto (an upscale Japanese restaurant), a high end BMW that he has no license to drive, and a swanky Manhattan apartment that he’s not old enough to move into.

The real “Wolf of Wall Street” wasn’t exactly role model material, and as the Inquisitr pointed out, even the movie was beleaguered in controversy and monetary fraud. Hopefully the catchy nickname “Teen Wolf” can be re-imaged by the smart and tenacious teen from New York City."
351,"London (AFP) - The British government on Saturday said it had received reports that ""Jihadi John"", the British-accented Islamic State militant apparently responsible for the beheading of western hostages, had been injured in a US air strike.

The Foreign Office could not confirm reports published in the Mail on Sunday that the masked executioner, who has appeared in a series of grisly videos posted online, had been wounded while attending a meeting of IS leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last week.

According to the paper, he was rushed to hospital following the US-led attack on a bunker in Al Qaim, western Iraq, on Saturday that killed around 10 IS commanders and wounded 40 more.

The Mail reported that it was the same attack that injured elusive IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, sparking initial rumours that he had been killed.

""Jihadi John"", named after Beatle John Lennon due to his British background, is believed to be responsible for the murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Allan Henning.

Despite being a foreigner, the masked assassin, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, has become a leading figure in the Islamist group that swept across Syria and northern Iraq.

The Mail claimed that a nurse who treated some of those wounded in the attack said there was a man named Jalman on her list, referring to him as ""the one who slaughtered the journalists"".

The wounded men were then driven to the IS's Syrian stronghold of Raqa, according to the Mail's source.

British intelligence officers estimate that there are around 500 home-grown militants fighting for IS in Syria and Iraq, and Prime Minister David Cameron this week announced plans to stop them returning to Britain for two years."
353,"A group of twenty women armed with AK-47 assault rifles stare defiantly at a camera. Most appear to be civilians, although three of them are wearing military-style camouflage uniforms. One woman stands in front of the rest, her rifle aimed forward at waist level. The muzzle appears to have been taped over, possibly to keep dust out of the barrel.

On Twitter, Facebook and the Web, the women have been hailed as heroes in the fight against Boko Haram militants in northern Nigeria. “Nigerian women who repulsed a Boko Haram attack, kudos to these gutsy bravehearts,” read a typical tweet of the image this week.

The photograph has been circulating for some time. We found posts dating to 2013, but the image appears to have gone viral in April 2014, around the time that more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants in Chibok. It has gained renewed currency since this month’s Baga massacre and the battle for the city of Maiduguri.

Boko Haram attack repelled by ‘armed women’

Many of the more recent tweets link to a fringe news website, Countercurrentnews.com, and a post dated 27 May 2014. The photo is prominently displayed. “Another Boko Haram attack repelled by armed women,” reads the headline.

“Several Nigerian media outlets have been reporting on local women in the villages of Attagara and Kawuri in Borno State who recently disarmed nearly a dozen Boko Haram terrorists,” the article continues.

“The notorious pseudo-Islamic terror groups tried to attack the Attagara and Kawuri communities over the weekend but the insurgents were instantly repelled by a group of armed women.”

‘Get ‘em ladies’

Screen Shot 2015-01-30 at 9.40.33 AMA pro-gun Facebook page in the United States that calls itself “Hypocrisy and Stupidity of Gun Control Advocates” has also appropriated the photo, suggesting that it shows a group of Nigerian teachers.

It posted the image on 20 January 2015, along with this caption: “When Boko Haram showed up to kill and rape us and our students we didn’t hide or throw spaghetti-os…We shot them in the face because we don’t ‘demand’ action – we take action.”

The picture was shared more than 400 times and by 30 January 2015, just over 1,200 Facebook users had “liked” it. “You get ’em ladies,” wrote one. “I find their lack of belt fed weapons and RPGs troubling,” said another. “Face shooting is definitely the way to go,” added a third.

Solving a mystery

We were intrigued. Where was the photograph taken? What had happened? Who were the women? Were they teachers? Villagers? Vigilantes? We decided to do a little cyber-sleuthing.

The first clue was a green, yellow and red football shirt worn by a woman in the back row. The second was a bright blue dress worn by another woman with white patches bearing a symbol in similar shades of green, yellow and red. Could they be colours of a national flag?

The Nigerian flag is green and white. The flag of neighbouring Benin is green, yellow and red but not all the bands run parallel. The colours also appear in Mali’s flag. Usually they run vertically, not horizontally, as they do in the football shirt. But a Google search for images of “Mali football jersey” produced photos of football shirts strikingly similar to that worn by the woman in the back row.

Verifying images

Two invaluable tools that we regularly use at Africa Check to establish the veracity of photos circulating online are Google’s image search function and the “reverse image search” engine, Tineye-com. (For more tips, check out our guide to spotting online fakes and hoaxes.)

We uploaded the image to Google. The results weren’t encouraging. There were dozens of links to web pages, Facebook posts and tweets all claiming that the photograph showed armed Nigerian women who had fought off Boko Haram. None offered any details of where the picture had been taken and who had taken it.

In fact, the image had been so widely published in relation to Boko Haram that Google’s suggested search term after we uploaded it was “boko haram women”.

We changed the search term to “Mali” and hit enter.

The claim is a hoax

As it turns out, our hunch was correct. The photo was first published on 23 November, 2012 in The Times of London. It had been taken by a Times photographer, Jack Hill, in the town of Sevare in Mali and accompanied an article by one of the newspaper’s correspondents, Jerome Starkey, about “women bent on revenge against Tuareg rebels in Mali”.

The women – all members of the Ganda Koy militia, a pro-government paramilitary force – had vowed to avenge relatives they said had been killed or raped by Tuareg rebels belonging to the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). Few, if any of the women, had seen combat when the photograph was taken.

The story of the Nigerian teachers standing up to Boko Haram militants is nothing more than a hoax.

A wrap of online fakes and hoaxes

There are numerous images circulating online that purport to show Boko Haram atrocities. Some are genuine. Many are not.

Earlier this month, the militant group attacked the towns of Doro Gowon and Baga in northern Nigeria. Eyewitnesses say hundreds were killed and satellite images obtained by human rights groups show that dozens of shops, houses and buildings were torched.

In the weeks since the attack a series of graphic images have spread online as evidence of what has become known as the “Baga massacre”.

Here’s our wrap of the images we have fact-checked so far.

(WARNING: Some of the photographs in the links below are extremely graphic.)

One of the most disturbing photographs shows dozens of charred corpse lying in rows. However the image actually shows the aftermath of a fuel tanker explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2010.

Another ghastly image shows the burnt corpses of a mother and child. We have been unable to verify its exact origin, but searches on Google and the reverse image search engine, Tineye.com, show that the image has been circulating since at least 2010 and is therefore not from the recent Baga attacks. Given the condition of the bodies, they may have been victims of the fuel tanker explosion, but we cannot say for certain.

Yet another photograph attributed to the Baga massacre shows a crowd clustered around a mass grave. However, that image dates from a massacre near the Nigerian city of Jos in March 2010.

Then there is the image of a number of grotesquely mutilated corpses strewn across a road next to a bus. It was actually taken in 2010. According to a BBC report at the time, a series of photographs emerged after armed robbers attacked a bus on the Lagos-Benin highway. The victims had reportedly been made to lie down in the road and then the bus driver was ordered to run them over.

Even a Reuters photograph of a group of men lying face down outside a police station after their arrest in the city of Bauchi in northeastern Nigeria on 25 July 2009 has been passed off as evidence of the Baga massacres and has spread widely on the web and Twitter.

Another image that has gone viral on Twitter shows a pile of bloodied bodies lying in street. It is also not from Baga but was taken in July 2009 by an Associated Press photographer outside a police station in the town of Maiduguri after clashes between Nigerian troops and Islamist militants left hundreds dead.

Not all the hoaxes involve images of atrocities. A photograph of two men in camouflage uniform being chased by a zebra has been widely distributed as evidence of the Nigerian army’s cowardice. Trouble is, there are no zebras in the wild in Nigeria. It turns out that the photograph was actually taken by a Reuters photographer in Kenya on 30 July 2007. Two Kenya Wildlife Service rangers, working to help move 2,000 animals to the Meru National Park, had to make a run for it when a recalcitrant zebra charged them.

371,"Bowe Bergdahl exited Taliban captivity in exchange for the U.S. releasing five jihadists to the government of Qatar, and now a U.S. senator claims those jihadists are “in touch” with an al-Qaida affiliate, which would confirm the fears of critics who objected to the deal made by the Obama administration.

CNN reported on January 29 that at least one of the five jihadists “has attempted to return to militant activity.”

“Several U.S. officials across different agencies and branches of the U.S. government have confirmed key details to CNN. The White House referred CNN to the Pentagon.”

CNN added that the U.S. allegedly believes this based on “an ongoing U.S. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in Qatar.”

Pentagon suspects detainee exchanged for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl attempting militant activity @barbarastarrcnn reports http://t.co/CWPGE3VWDF

— Barbara Starr (@barbarastarrcnn) January 29, 2015

The Associated Press provided a similar report, adding a named official to back up the assertion that the jihadists released for Bergdahl are now looking to return to terrorism.

“Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday that the Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have been in touch with members of the al-Qaida linked Haqqani network, yet all five still are being monitored in Qatar.”

Graham’s alleged assertions about the status of the five jihadists apparently is based on his visit to Qatar. The AP said that Graham “had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country,” although the Qatari government later assured him that all five jihadists remained in its borders, per the agreement with the U.S. government.

This latest news involving the terrorists exchanged for Bergdahl comes at a time when the Obama administration is dealing with rumors regarding the ongoing investigation into his conduct leading up to his capture.

The Inquisitr previously reported that some pundits and news outlets are claiming the government has decided to charge Bergdahl with desertion.

However, the U.S. Department of Defense flatly denies such allegations. Meanwhile, this denial has caused more speculation on how the unofficial allegations and official denial of those allegations might be part of an ongoing fight behind the scenes.

In fact, the Daily Signal argued the seemingly inconsistent “statements are not inconsistent.”

“Shaffer and Miklaszewski report that Bergdahl will be charged—ostensibly soon. Kirby is merely saying Bergdahl has not been charged yet. And by saying Bergdahl has not had charges referred against him, he is betting the press and public don’t understand the unique procedural steps in the court-martial process.”

The White House had not issued a statement on the latest reports regarding the alleged attempt of one or more of the jihadists released for Bergdahl to return to terrorism as of the time of the publication of this article.

373,"As Apple gears up to launch the Apple Watch in April this year, Tim Cook while talking to an employee at the Apple Store spilled some extra information about the wearable before the launch. He also gave a tentative time-frame as to when Apple Pay will be reaching Europe. Also, analysts have predicted what Apple might offer at the time of its smartwatch launch.

While we already know that Apple Watch will be water resistant, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple further confirmed it as shower-proof, while chatting with a Kurfurstendamm Apple Store (Berlin) employee. Reported by iGen (via 9to5Mac), the CEO said that he always wears the watch - ""even in the shower"". Cook added that he puts his Apple Watch on charge every night, which reconfirms the expected battery life from Apple's previous statements and multiple reports.

Regarding Apple Pay, Cook said that the firm plans to bring the service to Europe not ""before the end of the year."" The announcement is somewhat a contradiction to announcements by UK banks, which in the recent past stated they were in talks to bring the Apple Pay system by the first half of 2015. According to Cook, the mobile payment system should reach Canada as soon as next month.

Meanwhile, Trip Chowdhry, an analyst from Global Equities Research has predicted that Apple might introduce as many as 100,000 apps for the Apple Watch by time it gets launched. The huge number comes from six ""Apple Watch-Kit hackathons"" in the past few months, which Chowdhry attended, according to a Barrons blog post.

He further states that the $350 (roughly Rs. 21,700) price tag for the smartwatch seems to be no issue because ""On an average an Apple Watch user will have 100 Apps installed, and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting 100 devices for $350..i.e. $3.50 (roughly Rs. 217) per device,"" considering each app and its function as a single device.

As for the sales, Apple is being expected to ship almost 42 million units by December this year. ""Since Apple Watch extends iPhone functionality and provides user convenience with 'Glance' and 'Notifications' to an iPhone User, almost every current iPhone user, which are about 350 million users, will also be an Apple Watch user,"" he explains.

381,"“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2015 that is scheduled to be released during winter. The latest reports, however, claim that J.J. Abrams, the director of the seventh episode of the epic space opera, wants an early release date for his movie.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is currently scheduled to be released on Dec. 18, 2015. Based on YouTuber Votesaxon 07’s video, Movie Pilot reports that J.J. Abrams wants to release “Episode 7” in the summer of 2015. The report by the aforementioned entertainment news publication claims that the 48-year-old director made the announcement at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015.

The publication claims that the reason why J.J. Abrams wants to release “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” almost six months before its scheduled date is the alleged plot and images leaks from the sets and script. The moviemaker is now worried that these plot leaks will make the film “predictable and not worth watching” for the audience.

According to the website, moving the release date forward would be “an extremely brave move,” putting it up against other fan-favourite releases such as “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Jurassic World” and “Ant-Man.” However, shifting the release date means a lot of work for the moviemakers and the studio. Meanwhile, Ikwiz reports that Disney is “seriously” considering J.J. Abrams' demand of summer release of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

Fans must note that these reports lack official comments from the associated parties; thus, the information must be taken with a pinch of salt. However, fans know that Disney is seriously dealing with the issue of image leak. Recently, the studio issued a subpoena over the leak of images from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

In additional news, J.J. Abrams finally broke his silence on the controversy over the new lightsaber that debuted in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” trailer. Speaking to Collider at a Hollywood event, the director admitted receiving tons of emails arguing about the new lightsaber and its functionality.

""It's been the funniest thing to see the arguments that have developed over this thing,” J.J Abrams said. ""This was not done without a lot of conversation. It's fun to see people have the conversation that we had, but in reverse,” the director explained.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” features John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, Harrison For as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and Domhnall Gleeson, Max von Sydow and Adam Driver, all in unspecified roles. Stay tuned for more updates.

428,"Sony's high-profile biopic of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs will have plenty of award winning pedigree behind it, as Oscar winning actor Christian Bale will reportedly play the lead on the project, which also features an Academy Award winning director and screenwriter.

Bale is apparently in final talks to take on the role of Jobs, according to film industry publication Variety, which believes the casting is essentially a done deal. Bale will be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for Best Director in 2008 for the film ""Slumdog Millionaire.""

The two are working from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who himself won an Oscar in 2011 for penning ""The Social Network."" The film is expected to be loosely based on Walter Isaacson's official Jobs biography.

There has been some turmoil behind the scenes on the project, as director David Fincher was previously attached, but reportedly walked away after making demands of $10 million in up front payment and full control over marketing. Sony, which is responsible for the film, was apparently reluctant to make that commitment after a marketing debacle with Fincher's adaptation of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.""

Bale won an Oscar in 2011 for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in ""The Fighter."" He was also nominated last year for Best Actor for ""American Hustle,"" but is perhaps best known for playing Batman in Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" trilogy."
444,"Hospital authorities are carrying out an investigation after a mentally ill woman was spotted apparently trying to eat her baby shortly after giving birth.

The shocking incident happened at a hospital in the city of Shenzhen in southern China’s Guangdong Province, where the woman had been discovered heavily pregnant and in labour on the street.

She had been taken into the hospital and had given birth, and then placed in a ward where attempts had been made to contact her family as she was left to nurse the child.

However on the woman's third day in hospital, nurse Liu Tianlun had gone into the bedroom to find the young mother biting her son on the arm. When the nurse raised the alarm and tried to pull the baby free, the mother had refused to let go and continued to bite the tiny limb.

A hospital spokesman said: ""It was really shocking, the arm was badly damaged and suffered not only heavy bruising but bleeding as a result of the bite. Fortunately, doctors managed to insert something to stop her closing her teeth and then levered her jaws apart. After that they gave her a sedative and took the baby to a secure location.""

Police said the woman had been identified as 24-year-old Li Zhenghua. They said enquiries had found that, despite being pregnant, her mother-in-law had thrown her out on the street after Li started behaving oddly. The family did not alert anybody that Li was pregnant and might be in need of help.

She had apparently survived on the streets for at the very least several weeks and possibly longer before she was spotted in labour and the alarm was raised.

An investigation is now going on to decide what prompted the woman's actions and whether the child should be officially confiscated from both her and her husband's family, who no longer seem to want anything to do with her, and also possibly her child."
447,"An American blogger has said she aborted her baby when she found out it was a boy because she “hates the patriarchy.”

The woman, who is known only as Lana, describes herself as a feminist who has fought for women’s rights “to the point of eschewing a career”.

She wrote that when she found out she was pregnant in 2012 she was overjoyed until she realised it was a boy.

“I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.

“Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was just… sheltering me.”

After three days of mourning about the idea of bringing a “monster” into the world, she decided to go to an abortion clinic and have the foetus removed.

She said: “I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

“If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.”

She wrote that during her experiences of fighting for women’s rights, she found that “men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances”.

“This didn’t surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it,” she wrote.

Lana’s blog post has since received much criticism, with people calling her a “mentally ill female”, and writing messages such as: “Her mother already brought a monster into the word by giving birth to HER!”

On her blog Lana wrote that she had lost many friends and family members over the last three years, and responded to the criticism she had received.

“I cannot believe some of the emails that have been forwarded to me, do people really exist who want to see me dead because of what I chose to do with my own body?,” she wrote.

“The thing that I hope everyone takes away from all of this is that I own the reasons why I chose to have an abortion. Most of you reading probably have no idea what it is like to go through the process of debating whether or not to abort a pregnancy, let alone the actual experience of it.

“To me, the experience was liberating, the emotions I felt when deciding what I should do, and after learning my foetus was male was something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. Coming out of it a liberated woman though was more than worth it.”

Abortion based on gender is already illegal here in the UK, but MPs have been fighting to clarify the amendment to the 1967 Abortion Act that states this.

The amendment reads: ""Nothing in section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child.""

A Telegraph investigation found that gender-based abortion does still take place in the UK, with some cultures favouring boys over girls."
448,"Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner wants to put an end to werewolf bar mitzvahs once and for all.

Kirchner adopted Argentinian teen Yair Tawil as her godson as part of a folktale that says the seventh-born son in a family will turn into a werewolf and eat unbaptized babies, the New York Daily News reports.

This may sound familiar to fans of 30 Rock:

Source: YouTube

Wait, what? According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared ""el lobizon,"" the Independent explains. The werewolf-like beast ""shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy's 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.""

The legend seems ridiculous, but the Independent reports that fear of the creature was so widespread in 19th century Argentina that some families even murdered their babies. Fear and panic gave rise to the unusual practice of adoption by Argentina's president in 1907, which is meant to quell the deadly stigma ad demystify the folklore that was causing the abuse of children. Now a time-honored tradition, any family with seven sons or daughters today gets the president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.


The boy's parents, Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, had written the president's office requesting the adoption in 1993, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported. President Kirchner reportedly described the adoption as a ""magical moment,"" calling the Tawils a ""marvelous family.""

But are they more marvelous than this?

458,"British actor poised to take the lead in Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle, after Leonardo DiCaprio pulled out

Christian Bale is back in line to play Steve Jobs in a new biopic about the Apple co-founder after Leonardo DiCaprio backed out in order to take a break from acting.

The film industry magazine Variety reports that Bale will take the lead in the film Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin, scriptwriter of The Social Network and The West Wing.

Based on Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs: the Exclusive Biography, the film will be divided into three long scenes taking place in real time, each set on the eve of a product launch. Sorkin has revealed that the products are the Mac in 1984; the NeXT computer Jobs launched in 1990 after leaving Apple; and the iPod, which launched 2001.

David Fincher had originally been announced as the film’s director, but left the project after an argument with Sony about his salary and the marketing of the film. Bale had been Fincher’s first choice to play Jobs.

Bale and Boyle are set to shoot the film in spring 2015. Sorkin said that writing a film about Jobs “is a little like writing about the Beatles. There are so many people out there that know him and revere him.”"

According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the militant group has Russian-made MiG 21 and 23 warplanes.

The Observatory said the militants are being trained at the al Jarrah airbase on the eastern side of Aleppo.

He said local activist had contacted his organisation having spotted the planes flying low over the area. ""It is worth mentioning that it is not the first time that the people witness an aircraft flying at a low altitude after taking off from al Jarrah airbase,"" Rahman said, adding that the jets were purportedly stolen by militants who had occupied airports and airbases affiliated to the Syrian government.

The SOHR said it could not confirm if the Islamic State had any access to missiles.

Separately, UK authorities have charged four men with terror offences, including taking an oath of allegiance to IS.

The Metropolitan Police force said the men, Tarik Hassane, Suhaib Majeed, Nyall Hamlett and Momen Motasim, who were arrested in London over the past two weeks, were charged with preparing acts of terrorism between July and October, including procuring a Baikal handgun and ammunition and using Google Street View to conduct reconnaissance on a police station and an army barracks in west London."
507,"HELL hath no fury like a woman scorned.

A jealous wife in China chopped off her cheating husband’s penis as he slept, then snuck into his hospital room after he had it sewn back on — and hacked it off again and tossed it out the window.

Fan Lung, a dad of five, sealed his fate when he decided to use his wife’s cellphone to send his secret lover a hot and heavy email, Central European News reports.

The 32-year-old forgot to log out of his account after the message was sent, which is how his 21-year-old wife, Feng — who is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm — came across the saucy exchange and snapped.

The jilted wife went berserk, grabbed a pair of scissors, stormed into their bedroom and cut off his penis while he was sleeping.

Lung was rushed to the hospital, where doctors were able to save the appendage and sew it back on.

But Feng was able to sneak into the recovery room, where she chopped his penis off a second time and threw it out the window, according to CEN.

A shocked Lung chased his wife outside, despite losing a lot of blood.

“Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman,” a hospital spokesman said. “He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.”

Despite desperate search efforts, authorities were unable to find Lung’s manhood. Police believe it may have been stumbled upon by a stray dog or cat, according to CEN.

The woman Lung was cheating with — Zhang Hung, 21 — said she’s OK with her man not being able to have more children.

“It doesn’t matter that he’s lost his fertility,” she told CEN. “He has five children already.”"

Henry “Big Bank Hank” Jackson of the Sugarhill Gang died early Tuesday from kidney complications due to cancer, his manager said. He was 57.

“[Sugarhill Gang's Wonder Mike and Master Gee] had been in contact with him in the past year,” manager David Mallie told FOX411. “They had some great times and created history.”

“So sad to hear of our brother’s passing. Rest in peace Big Bank,” the two remaining members of the group said.

Sugarhill Gang is best known for its 1979 hit “Rapper’s Delight.” Other members of the rap community posted remembrances of Big Bank Hank on social media:

549,"Hugh Hefner was presumed to be dead of natural causes, Sunday, December 28, 2014. Well, that’s the story which was given from a fake sub-medium of NBC called NBCToday.co. This site can’t be called news satire because once “nbctoday.co” is entered as the URL address, it takes the user straight to the fake story.

Though the story is fake, it spread like wildfire, seemingly without anyone bothering to research the issue himself or herself.

As of 11 p.m. PST, the Hugh Hefner fake-death story had over 159,000 Facebook shares, along with over 39,000 Likes. Likewise, it has approximately 1800 Twitter shares. Unfortunately, by sunrise, this fake Hugh Hefner story may be trending.

The story states that police responded to Hugh Hefner’s estate on December 28 at approximately 9 a.m., where Hefner’s body was identified, and he was pronounced dead.

However, as can be seen from his wife Crystal Hefner”s Twitter update, Hugh is alive and enjoying his time with family.

Movie night with the family pic.twitter.com/65QaTvJDNL

— Crystal Hefner (@crystalhefner) December 29, 2014

Fortunately, the entire story is fabricated. The only other possibility is that he died and was revived. However, there is nothing on Crystal Hefner’s social media that indicates any kind of scare of such magnitude.

However, she does offer a witty quote regarding the Hugh Hefner death story.

A lie can run around the world before the truth has got it’s boots on. #QuoteOfTheDay

— Crystal Hefner (@crystalhefner) December 29, 2014

This statement, along with the “family night” photo, was made only a few hours ago. Whereas, Hugh Hefner was supposed to have been dead around 9 a.m. And unless Hugh has someone managing his social media profiles, he made his own tweets shortly before his wife.

Tonight’s Mansion movie is “American Sniper.”

— Hugh Hefner (@hughhefner) December 29, 2014

He also retweeted what his wife tweeted afterwards. So sensibly, had Hugh Hefner passed, there would be a buzzing frenzy coming from the Playmates, let alone the rest of the media world.

It would benefit many to perform a little research before taking things as they come.

@crystalhefner Dear Crystal Sorry for your loss, may God bless you and your family!

And that comment was after Crystal stated that the story wasn’t true.

However, there is one thing the anonymous writer got right. Hugh Hefner is 88 years of age. It seems as though he doesn’t plan on letting go of life just yet."
563,"Oct 6 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.

HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year.

Shares of the company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, were up 5.1 percent at $37 in premarket trading on Monday.

Each of the two businesses contribute about half of HP's current revenue and profit.

The move will result in a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue the fiscal year ending October.

""Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates,"" Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.

Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP, which had a market value of about $66 billion as of Friday.

Many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the personal computer business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations of providing computer servers, networking and data storage to businesses.

HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.

Online auction company eBay Inc said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.

WHITMAN TO LEAD ENTERPRISE

HP's current chief executive, Meg Whitman, will lead the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will house the corporate hardware and services operations.

Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.

HP's printing and personal computing business, to be known as HP Inc, will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc.

Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution.

Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals such as Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which is now the world's No. 1 PC maker by shipments.

Dell Inc, which is HP's closest U.S. competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year.

HP's PC business has shown signs of life in recent quarters, growing broadly geographically as businesses replace aging machines.

HP on Monday affirmed its fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.70 to $3.74 per share. It also forecast 2015 adjusted earnings of $3.83-$4.03 per share, in line with the average analyst estimate of $3.95, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

HP's announcement on Monday confirmed a report of the split in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.

Up to Friday's close, HP's stock had risen nearly 26 percent this year. (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bangalore, David Henry in New York, Edwin Chan in San Francisco and Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Savio D'Souza)

In December, the message was lost during a service upgrade, which left the 68-year-old Brit ""absolutely devastated"" and also ""extremely angry,"" according to the BBC. So he contacted Virgin Media to see if they could retrieve it and -- with the help of nearly a dozen engineers -- they did.

566,"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Houthi rebels took all U.S. Embassy vehicles parked at the Yemeni capital's airport and wouldn't let departing U.S. Marines take their weapons with them, a top Sanaa airport official said about the latest evidence of unrest in an Arab nation long seen as key in America's fight against terrorists.

The actions come after the United States, along with Britain, suspended operations at their embassies and moved out staffers because of the instability in Yemen.

According to the official, the Houthis seized many U.S. Marines' weapons at the airport, and the American troops also handed over some to random airport officials.

However, a senior U.S. military official told CNN the Marines disabled their weapons and gave them to a Yemeni security detail, which had escorted them to the airport, because the Marines were flying commercial.

The U.S. Marine Corps sharply denied the allegations.

""All crew served weapons were destroyed at the embassy prior to movement. None of them were 'handed over' in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan,"" the statement read.

The statement continued: ""To be clear: No Marine handed a weapon to a Houthi, or had one taken from him.""

The previous night, embassy officials burned tens of thousands of documents and destroyed weapons that were inside the Sanaa embassy's storage warehouses, Yemeni employees of the embassy said.

What you need to know about Yemen

Yemen has been an important country to the United States as the home of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the most feared, influential and operational terrorist organizations in the world. U.S. officials have had a long relationship with Yemeni leaders, working with them to target AQAP militants.

But now, Yemen's latest leader, President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, is gone, having resigned after Houthi rebels seized control of key government facilities, dissolved parliament and placed him under house arrest.

All this movement has left the Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- as the pre-eminent power in Yemen.

Their takeover hasn't been smooth and it's not clear whether it will ever be complete. There has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa.

Then there's the question of what it means for the United States and its anti-terrorism efforts.

U.S. special forces stay in Yemen

As of last month, U.S. officials hadn't engaged in talks with the Houthis, though there were discussions about whether to talk to them.

Still, even amid the turmoil, the U.S. military remains active in Yemen.

Take, for instance, the killing of senior AQAP cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari and three other people in a drone strike on their vehicle on January 31.

""They are still capable of conducting counterterrorism operations in Yemen, and frankly ... there's some counterterrorism training that's still ongoing ... with Yemeni security forces,"" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman.

""I'd be less than honest if I said that there hadn't been some adjustments already made because of the political uncertainty,"" he said. ""We're just going to have to watch this closely going forward.""

Yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against AQAP, which has been tied to the failed attempt by ""underwear bomber"" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab and Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan. More recently, the terror group has been linked to the slaughter at French magazine Charlie Hebdo.

""They are a very dangerous group,"" said Kirby. ""They do want to threaten Western interests, including U.S. interests, and we do consider them a threat to the United States of America. We're watching them very closely.""

The Lede: Investigation Suggests American Journalist Missing in Syria Is ‘Likely’ Held by GovernmentMAY 3, 2013
Titled “A Message to America,” the video shows the journalist kneeling in a desert landscape, clad in an orange jumpsuit — an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Standing to his left is a masked ISIS fighter, who begins speaking in English, with what sounds like an East London accent. Pulling out a knife, he says that Mr. Foley’s execution is in retaliation for the recent American airstrikes ordered by President Obama against the extremist group in Iraq.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers — the U.S. government — for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” Mr. Foley says in the video, which was uploaded to the online account of the al-Furqan Media Foundation, according to SITE, an organization that follows jihadist groups. He ends saying that when American soldiers began dropping bombs on Iraq this month, “they signed my death certificate.”

On Tuesday night, Mr. Foley’s mother, Diane Foley, issued a statement on the Facebook page the family had created to publicize their son’s disappearance: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people. We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”

Two weeks ago, in the wake of American-led airstrikes against the terrorist group, which was fanning out across Iraq, jihadists had taken to social media to call for attacks on American interests. In the three hours after the graphic video of Mr. Foley’s beheading was uploaded on YouTube, jihadists using the hashtag “#NewMessageFromISIStoUS” surpassed 2,000 tweets, according to a survey by SITE, with many fighters gloating over his death, and calling it just retribution for the air raids.

Mr. Foley, 40, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost, an online publication based in Boston, as well as for Agence France-Presse, disappeared in Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. He was held alongside several other Americans, whose families have asked for a news blackout.

The video concludes with the fighter threatening to kill Steven Sotloff, another American freelance journalist, who was being held alongside Mr. Foley. Mr. Sotloff is seen kneeling in the same position, in the same landscape and wearing the same style of orange-colored jumpsuit. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the fighter says.

Mr. Obama was briefed about the video by Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, on Air Force One as he returned to Martha’s Vineyard, according to Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary.

In Washington, a National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, said in a statement: “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist,” she said, using an alternative name for ISIS.

Reached by telephone, Philip Balboni, the chief executive and a founder of GlobalPost, said that the newsroom and Mr. Foley’s family were also trying to establish the veracity of the footage. “We are still evaluating the video at this time,” he said.

Mr. Foley, who was last seen in Binesh, Syria, was also abducted in Libya in 2011, where he was held for several weeks after running into troops loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s crumbling government.

He was among dozens of journalists — many of them freelancers without the formal backing of a news organization — who disappeared in 2012 and 2013 in Syria.

Correction: August 19, 2014 
An earlier version of a summary with this article misstated the location of the airstrikes that ISIS opposed. The terrorist group said it executed James Foley in retaliation for American airstrikes in Iraq, not Syria."

Does Jess Smith look familiar? If so, it's probably because she's still recognisable as the Teletubbies sun baby - almost 20 years after she starred in the kids' show.

After 19 years, the student has finally broken her silence and outed herself as the the baby face in mega-popular children's TV show.

She was selected to be the giggling baby sun, who looks over Teletubbyland at the age of nine months.

The show was a global hit and Jess, now 19, became one of the most famous faces in the world - but only her family ever knew it was her.

There were even rumours the true identity of the baby was another Jessica Smith - the 27-year-old star of American teen soap Laguna Beach.

But Jess has finally gone public and spoken for the first time about her iconic role in the TV show, which featured characters Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po.

Jess only revealed her secret past during a game with her university friends - where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

She then used Facebook to confirm it was her - and photos show she still has the same cheeky face.

Jess said: ""I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them.

""My mother is really chuffed.""

The first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University then made the news public on Facebook.

She wrote: ""So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.

""I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it.

""I am the sun from Teletubbies.

""There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.""

Sensation: The Teletubbies gang Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po

Jess added: ""I am really happy, cheerful and giggly. When I told my friends they said they could see me in the sun baby face.""

Jess' name was put forward when her mother Anji Smith, 44, a recruitment consultant, took her to be weighed at Edenbridge Hospital, Kent.

A health visitor had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies.

Jess was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.

Her furniture deliver father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.

As no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.

Delighted Mrs Smith said: ""It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

""They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.

""We didn't hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she'd been picked.

610,"On Friday, Esquire published an article titled “ESPN Has A Problem With Women” that suggests the network was planning to host a male-only panel discussion on domestic violence during this week’s “Monday Night Football” broadcast.

The article begins:

On Monday night, a panel on a two-hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will, among other things, address domestic abuse. This panel will discuss, once again, the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman.

The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis.

Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24.

When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they’ll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.

These people are not allowed at the table.

The assertion that ESPN would host such a panel discussion and not invite any women to participate sparked outrage.

THIS IS HORRIFYING http://t.co/lasYPHtbXl

Utterly speechless. RT @Lahlahlindsey THIS IS HORRIFYING http://t.co/ycDWFvwtfI …

ESPN Doesn’t Get It: They Ignore Women’s Voices In Public Dialog About Domestic Violence

ESPN’s Domestic Violence Panel Is Missing Something Important

11 Men and 0 Women on Tonight’s ESPN Domestic Violence Panel

Esquire writer Ben Collins who posted the original article took to Twitter to attempt to clarify what he wrote.

Hi, everybody now reading my ESPN story @Lahlahlindsey's tweet! Note: There's no special panel on tomorrow's Countdown for domestic violence

...Those are the people on the show every week. They haven't changed it in the last few weeks, either. Don't know if that's better or worse.

But there was a top sentence left off that tweet that's going around, and I wanted to clarify. ESPN is mad enough at me as it is. Thank you.

On Monday, ESPN’s John Wildhack, executive vice president of programming and production released a statement refuting Esquire’s original report that the network scheduled any sort of domestic violence panel discussion.

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.

ESPN published a blog post highlighting reporting on domestic abuse by its female staffers since the Ray Rice scandal broke last month.

ESPN also posted a list of highlights for tonight’s “Monday Night Football” broadcast, which includes no discussion about domestic violence.

ESPN reporter Jane McManus took to Twitter to debunk Esquire’s domestic violence panel story.

ESPN is about to release a statement. I'll go through a few points here. There was never a domestic violence panel planned for MNF tonight.

Since the Rice story broke, ESPN has featured several women prominently, including myself, @katefagan3, @SarahSpain @jemelehill etc.

Tonight's regular MNF panel will be hosted by Suzy Kolber. It was never meant to be a single-issue discussion of domestic violence.

Esquire did not immediately return a request for comment."
613,"Defence officials were unable to confirm local media reports that the Isis boss was among those hit

The US-led coalition against Isis has carried out a bomb attack on a convoy of senior militants that may have included the group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

American defence officials confirmed that the air strikes on Friday night destroyed 10 armoured vehicles near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, and that the mission had been ""against what was assessed to be a gathering of [Isis] leaders"".

Iraqi state television and two officials also said yesterday that the Isis leader had been wounded.

An Interior Ministry official and a senior Iraqi military official both told the Associated Press that the strike on Saturday had wounded Baghdadi, but gave no details about how bad his injuries might be, following speculation about his death.

The death of the elusive leader would mark a significant step change in the US-led effort to curtail the Islamist extremist group.

Among those reportedly confirmed killed in the strikes was Abdul Rahman al-Athaee, also known as Abu Saja, one of al-Baghdadi's key aides and a man who regularly travelled with the militant group's self-proclaimed ""caliph"" or spiritual leader.

But while the Al Arabiya News Channel quoted local tribal sources as saying that al-Baghdadi was ""critically wounded"" in the attack, neither US nor Iraqi officials were able to provide further details.

Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this morning, Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton discussed al-Baghdadi's ""potential death"", suggesting the UK is confident there is at least a strong chance the Isis leader may have been successfully targeted.

Gen Houghton said he could not ""absolutely confirm"" that al-Baghdadi was in the convoy, but warned that the terror group's leadership would ""regenerate"" regardless of his fate.

""What I wouldn't want to do is rush to the sense that the potential death of one of their totemic leaders is going to create some strategic reverse in Isis,"" he said.

The Pentagon has released a statement saying that it ""cannot confirm if [Isis] leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present"", nonetheless adding that the strikes as a whole ""demonstrate the pressure we continue to place on the IS terrorist network"".

Meanwhile on Sunday it also emerged that Iraqi military forces had reached the centre of the northern city of Baiji, a major gain in the battle for the country's biggest oil refinery located nearby.

An Iraqi army colonel said government troops entered Isis-occupied Baiji, a city of about 200,000 people, from the south and west and took over the al-Tamim neighbourhood and city centre.

Speaking before those gains in a CBS ""Face The Nation"" interview broadcast today, Barack Obama hailed what he called the ""very effective"" air strikes carried out by the international coalition.

""The air strikes have been very effective in degrading ISIL's capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making,"" the US President said.

""Now what we need is ground troops, Iraqi ground troops, that can start pushing them back.""

Obama announced on Friday that he had ordered the deployment of up to 1,500 more US soldiers to support Iraqi forces, which could bring the overall contribution of American troops in the country to 3,100."
621,"A Sept. 8 U.S. Department of Defense news article talking about the success of airstrikes in Iraq mentions a question from the media — and answer — about the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

From the article:

In response to a question about the reported deaths of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and some of his advisors in an air strike, (Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve) Warren  said the U.S. has not conducted any targeted airstrikes against specific ISIL personnel.

“I hope he’s dead. We certainly hope he’s dead, but we haven’t conducted any strikes against him,” he said.

“With every terrorist that we kill from the air, that is one less terrorist on the ground,” the colonel added.

Warren also said this in talking about the airstrikes against ISIS:

Certainly, ISIL forces realize that when American airpower is deployed, their chance of survival goes to nil.”

647,"With Apple Watch’s launch day edging ever closer, the company is reportedly preparing to make some changes at its global chain of stores in order to accommodate the most expensive version of its new smartwatch.

The tech company is said to be bringing tailor-made safes to its retail locations for the secure overnight storage of its gold Apple Watches, a move that it hopes will help deter nefarious types from considering a late-night shopping expedition of the smash ‘n’ grab variety.

The specially designed safes will hold demo devices as well as on-sale stock, and come equipped with MagSafe chargers so the demo units can begin each day fully charged, a source told 9to5Mac.

Related: Apple’s watch changes everything. Or does it?

The smartwatch model set for the special treatment – the Apple Watch Edition – incorporates a case crafted from 18-karat gold that Apple claims has been specially developed to be up to twice as hard as standard gold. It also features a display protected by polished sapphire crystal.

While it’s rare for Apple Stores to get hit by raids, it has been known to happen. With a new and expensive product about to arrive, it could make the stores more of a target, so it’s little surprise that the company is reportedly taking special measures to deter criminals.

The exact price of this particular version of Apple’s smartwatch is yet to be announced, though considering its premium materials, as well as the fact that the Cupertino company is acting to safeguard units outside of regular trading hours, it’s fair to assume that customers who go for the Edition will be laying down several thousand dollars at the least.

Speaking recently during a call with investors following Apple’s reporting of record-breaking quarterly earnings, CEO Tim Cook said its wrist-based computer should be arriving in stores in April.

A survey toward the end of last year suggested one in ten people with an iPhone would be “very likely” to buy an Apple Watch over the next 12 months, though it’s easy to imagine that figure will increase as the company ramps up its marketing efforts nearer to launch time."

The 40-year-old rapist, Suresh Kumar, was beaten with sticks for about an hour before his genitals was cut off.

The incident occurred in the city of Ganganagar, where Kumar was left bleeding as his penis and testicles lay on the road next to him.

An eyewitness, Aamir Dhawan, who was at the scene, said people were reluctant to help the rapist, after seeing that his private parts had been cut off.

He said, “No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime. We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped. This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that – if you do it you will be punished.”

The police, has however, urged those responsible for the castration to come forward and submit themselves for prosecution.

A police spokesman said, “People cannot take the law into your own hands. As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.”"
655,"Elon University in North Carolina banned the word “freshman” from its website and student orientation, claiming it’s sexist and suggests that the young women might make good rape victims.

It’s replacing the term with “first-year.”

“The term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time,” Leigh-Anne Royster, the school’s “Inclusive Community Wellbeing Director” told the College Fix.

“Given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses, it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way,” she added.

In fact, the word is apparently so dangerous that any orientation leader who dared to use it was immediately corrected.

“They engrained over and over in our brains that it was supposed to be ‘first-year,’ not ‘freshman,’” sophomore orientation leader Alaina Schukraft told the Fix. “They were very adamant . . . and stressed the importance of using language that would make the new students feel comfortable.” 

Ironically, Schukraft said that multiple students approached her and said they were actually more comfortable with the word “freshman.”

But no matter. Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, insists that it will make the school a better place for women — telling the Fix that people consider “freshman” to be a “sexist” word.

“As an inclusive community, Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body,” Zaiser said in an e-mail to the Fix.

No public announcement was made about the word switch. According to the Fix, administrators relied “largely on word of mouth.”

660,"The Apple Watch has been scheduled to begin shipping in April according to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook. Now presumably Apple might want to make some kind of announcement regarding the prices and the finalized specs of the device, and given that it is their first wearable, it doesn’t seem like a stretch.
That being said, a report from French Apple website iGen (via AppleInsider) claims to have heard from their sources that this event could be held on the 24th of February in which Apple is expected to share the finalized specs and launch plans for the Apple Watch, and will also be announcing the rumored 12-inch MacBook Air.
Previously we have heard rumors that the 12-inch MacBook Air could be launched in Q1 2015 so an announcement either in February or by the end of March would coincide with the rumors. However we should also note that the folks at 9to5Mac have heard from their own sources that the 24th of February event will not be happening.
9to5Mac does not dispute the possibility of Apple holding a special event to launch their new products, but rather the actual date which their sources have told them will not be the 24th of February. Given that both websites have been pretty reliable when it comes to Apple rumors, it’s hard to say who’s right. Either way we will be keeping our eyes and ears peeled for a possible invite, but in the meantime try not to get your hopes up just yet.

After he pushed past the female agent, he ran past the stairway that leads to the president’s personal quarters before he was detained.

The Secret Service’s response to Gonzalez’s dash from the front railing was slowed because perimeter alarms — dubbed “crash boxes” — had been muffled at the request of the White House’s ushers.

The man, Omar Gonzalez, is a former soldier, and was having delusions. The president was not at the White House when Gonzalez ran into the building.

The new revelation was published by the Washington Post and CBS.

The Post credited the new information to whistleblowers and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight subcommittee on Homeland Security.

Chaffetz said the intrusion was a “failure of leadership” by the Secret Service.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the intrusion was “unacceptable” to her.

The report — likely leaked by Chaffetz — comes one day before Pierson testifies at his committee on Tuesday.

“The agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,” Chaffetz told the Washington Post.

“It must examine what message is being sent to the men and women who protect the president when their leader sacrifices security to appease superficial concerns of White House ushers.”

680,"Isis fighter denies claim and says organ-harvesting 'would bring in peanuts'

Iraq’s ambassador to the United Nations is calling on the UN Security Council to investigate allegations that Isis is harvesting organs, telling ministers: ""We have bodies. Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts.""

Mohamed Alhakim claimed militants are harvesting the organs as a way of financing the extremist group’s activities.

He also told journalists doctors in Mosul were “executed” for refusing to harvest organs, the Associated Press reports.

Mr Alhakim said bodies with surgical incisions and missing organs had been discovered in shallow mass graves.

He was earlier speaking to the UN council about the state of affairs in Iraq, where he also accused Isis of ""crimes of genocide"" in targeting certain ethnic groups.

However, Elijah J. Magnier, Al Rai's chief international correspondent, said Mr Alhakim’s claims should be treated cautiously. He told The Independent: “Isis doesn't have the market in this current global war against it to be engaged in this business [organ harvesting]. This requires contacts that Isis is losing.”

An Isis fighter was also quick to deny claims made by Mr Alhakim, saying the group would not have time to collect the organs of those they killed.

He was quoted by Mr Magnier as saying: “If [these claims were] true, this would be a general policy for Isis that it would not be possible to hide.

""People are shot in the head, beheaded, bodies thrown in the desert, others left in the battle field and more were dropped in deep wells. Fighters don't have the time to stop in the battle field and collect bodies of their own fighters.

“So how could we collect bodies of those we kill and transport them to sell their organs? ""

Another fighter said it would be easier to harvest organs from prisoners but the group chooses not to, saying: “Organs are preserved naturally in prisoners and could be harvested when needed.

""It is easier to harvest organs from prisoners than from the dead, which is not the case.""

The militant stressed that organ-selling would not raise substantial funds to maintain the group, saying: “The West is trying to find out where our funding comes from. This 'organ selling' would bring in peanuts in comparison what an Isis army needs each day.""

Some of Isis's known sources of finance include oil and taxes on every house, shop, vehicle and any goods crossing into Isis controlled areas.

Isis also reportedly imposes fines for civilians caught breaking rules in Raqqa, the group's Syrian stronghold. Activists recently spoke of the plight faced by citizens living under the group's self-declared caliphate, who face being publicly flogged, paying huge fines and even reportedly execution for 'crimes' such as smoking."
728,"The woman had reportedly taken a nap on the floor

A South Korean woman was taught a lesson about trying to do things the easy way when a robot vacuum cleaner sucked up her hair and left her trapped as she took a nap on the floor of her home.

The unnamed woman, 52, took a break between chores in her Changwon home in southeast South Korea.

She later awoke in agony after the machine mistook her hair for dust, forcing her to call the fire brigade with a “desperate plea” for help, The Guardian reports.

Emergency workers quickly worked to untangle her from the vacuum, which had ingested about 5cm of her hair.

Autonomous robot vacuum cleaners are programmed to clean and perform other basic household tasks at set times, suggesting the woman had forgotten what time hers was set to clean the floor at.

The woman was not injured in the incident."

Here is a troubling radio interview with her about why she allegedly got a third breast a few months ago and how hard it was to get one. She said that she was told to “sign a nondisclosure agreement” and had to call scores of doctors before she could find one who would do it because it was such a breach of ethics. She didn’t reveal the name of the doctor who performed the procedure.

Over the course of the interview, during which the hosts asked some unbelievably inappropriate questions, she said the surgery cost $20,000, that she saved up for two years so that it could happen, that her mum won’t talk to her and won’t let her sister talk to her, and that her dad is unhappy. She said it’s not just about fame.

On the station, the 21-year-old said: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

She said a “mini-implant” was put in so it had a nipple, and an areole was tattooed around it. The breasts apparently don’t quite “match up”.

She told the station: “The reaction has been crazy.”

“This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery.

798,"TOKYO — North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been hospitalized after surgery on both ankles earlier this month, a South Korean newspaper reported.

Kim cracked bones in his ankles after neglecting an injury sustained during field supervisions in June, the Chosun Ilbo said, citing a recent visitor to North Korea it didn’t identify. The person said Kim had surgery and is recovering at Bongwha Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members, according to the newspaper.

Kim has not been seen in public in almost a month and missed a session of parliament on Sept. 25 for the first time since coming to power almost three years ago. In an unusual acknowledgment, North Korean state television said he was experiencing “discomfort,” and South Korea’s Yonhap News reported he is believed to be suffering from gout.

Tuesday’s report comes as Glyn Davies, the top U.S. envoy for North Korea, said the isolated state is neglecting its responsibilities to end its nuclear weapon program. Speaking in Beijing on a trip through North Asia, Davies told reporters Monday it’s essential that North Korea moves toward denuclearization.


“Today’s news may even prompt an acceleration of North Korea’s nuclear program, and missile tests,” said Hideshi Takesada, a professor at Takushoku University in Tokyo who specializes in North Korean affairs. “He’ll probably be keen to show there are no issues in the nation’s power structure.”
The activities of North Korea’s leader are the subject of intense scrutiny in Asia and beyond because of his family’s dynastic rule, its drive to develop a nuclear arsenal and the secrecy of a regime that faces South Korea across one of the world’s most heavily-armed borders.

In fractured ankle cases, a doctor may need to set the broken bone back into place with a splint or cast, and surgery may be required to repair the break, according to WebMD, an online medical dictionary. It can take as long as two years to completely recover full pain-free motion and strength, though most people can return to a normal routine in three or four months.

Even so, speculation remains in the South Korean media that Kim may be unwell. Footage in July and earlier this month showed the country’s leader walking with a limp, and Kim appeared to have gained weight.

Surgery to the ankles could be consistent with gout, Alastair Hepburn, a consultant rheumatologist and a Medical Trustee of the U.K. Gout Society.

“It’s unusual but it’s possible,” Hepburn said in a telephone interview Tuesday. Severe gout can damage the joints, making an operation necessary, he said.
“Gout is a very painful and debilitating condition,” he said. “It can lead to a situation when limping becomes obvious because of the pain. A person can be quite well for some time, and then there may be sudden flare ups, which cause more pain.”

Sometimes the situation is solved, and other times, if the flare-ups keep occurring, the condition becomes chronic, Hepburn said.

Gout is a form of arthritis that isn’t fatal, though it can be agonizingly painful. The condition is caused by a buildup of a waste product in the blood called uric acid, which normally is eliminated from the body through urine, according to Britain’s National Health Service. Uric acid can cause needle-like crystals to form, which seep into joints and cause inflammation.

Surgery may be needed to remove gritty, chalky nodules known as tophi if uric acid crystals build up in joints, according to WebMD.

The South Korean government is cautious about making a hasty assessment of the situation given the amount of speculation over Kim’s disappearance from public view, Yonhap reported Tuesday, citing an unidentified government official. People will now be watching to see if he attends the anniversary of the Workers’ Party on Oct. 10., according to the news agency."
803,"A goldfish lover from Norfolk paid hundreds of pounds in vets' fees when his pet became constipated.

The owner took his ailing fish to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre in North Walsham where vets told him it was constipated and an operation would cost about £300.

Vet Faye Bethell used anaesthetised water to knock out the goldfish before removing the blockages.

""At the end of the day they're all pets and everybody does have a commitment to their pet,"" Miss Bethell said.

""[The goldfish] was constipated because he had a lump blocking his bottom, rather than because of his diet or any other reason,"" she said.

The operation, which took almost an hour, was performed by Miss Bethell, assisted by two veterinary nurses.

""We've got one nurse who bubbles anaesthetic gas through a tube that goes in through its mouth and over its gills, and then we have a second nurse to monitor with a probe to check the heart rate,"" Miss Bethell said.

""Obviously, we discussed all the options [with its owner] and he made the decision to go for surgery.

815,"The new season of Game of Thrones starts next month, and you know what that means: Cue the mad dash to secure someone's HBO Go password in time. But for cord cutters (and cord never-getters) who want to tune in online, this year may mark the first time they've been able to do so without breaking the rules.

HBO is reportedly in talks with Apple to be the launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service that wouldn't require a cable subscription, according to International Business Times. HBO Now, as it's allegedly being called, would cost $15/month and open up access to HBO's film and TV titles to distributors like Apple TV and Roku.

HBO's existing streaming app HBO Go is currently available only through a cable subscription. Last year, HBO announced that it would finally unbundle its streaming services from cable in 2015, and the HBO Now launch could be signals that HBO is making good on that promise.

It's unclear how the HBO Now library would measure up to HBO Go's current offerings, but the companies are reportedly trying to wrap up negotiations in time for the Season 5 premiere of Game of Thrones next month. So it's likely a safe bet that recent HBO content would be available through the Apple service.

At a price point that's double the monthly fee for both Netflix and Hulu, the new service had better deliver on quantity, as both services offer robust streaming libraries of their own. However, while the quality of the content on those services can vary wildly, the HBO brand is known for its acclaimed original series like The Wire, The Sopranos, and Six Feet Under.

Fans of HBO's programming, who increasingly occupy a demographic that's moving away from cable, have long craved a cable-free streaming service—but HBO has deflected the matter for years.

Presumably, the HBO Now launch must navigate the complexities of HBO's longstanding relationship with cable carriers—Time Warner, HBO's parent company, reportedly makes 70% of its profits from cable subscriptions. But if the current negotiations with Apple are successful, the Now service could be HBO's first crack at making good on its promise to cord cutters."
817,"It’s been more than a month since North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un’s last public appearance. In the last 36 days, rumors have swirled, increasing in bizarre factor with each absent day — gout, diabetes, ankle problems, cheese-induced illness, etc. But the latest theory has nothing to do with his health. A group of defectors claim that Kim Jong-un’s sister Kim Yo-jong is now in charge of the dictatorship, at least temporarily while Kim recuperates, or finishes whatever it is he’s been doing on his hiatus.

The claim comes from the North Korea Intellectuals’ Solidarity, a Seoul-based advocacy think tank started by former North Korean professors. The group has not revealed its source, so it’s just an allegation at this point, but one that makes sense.

According to Michael Madden, who tracks the country’s officials with his North Korea Leadership Watch blog, Kim Yo-jong is one of the few people known to have “unfettered direct access” to the supreme leader, and Madeen speculates that she may currently be his “sole gatekeeper.”

The sister theory comes amid some more serious theories that a coup may be imminent. On Saturday, three elite North Korean officials made an appearance at the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in South Korea, one of which was Organization and Guidance Department (OGD) member Hwang Pyong-so. The OGD has long been rumored to be the puppet masters of Kim’s regime, only allowing the portly leader to be a symbolic figurehead for the sake of continuing the Kim dynasty. Hwang’s appearance only further suggests that the OGD have seized control of the regime.

But if video evidence of Kim limping is any indication, the dictator is likely recovering from whatever mysterious “discomfort” he’s been experiencing, and little sis is making sure things still get done, as little sisters often do.

Who Is Kim Yo-Jong?

While Kim has a half-sister, whom his father, Kim Jong-il had with another wife, Kim Yo-jong is his only full sister. Four years younger at age 27, Kim Yo-jong reportedly joined her brother for elementary school in Switzerland from 1996 to 2000. Currently, she is an official in Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK), North Korea’s ruling political party. According to North Korea Leadership Watch, Kim Yo-jong works as her brother’s personal aide and manages his itineraries, public events, and logistical needs. Sounds like a hybrid of manager, publicist, and personal assistant.

Kim Yo-Jong’s Emergence

The North Korea Leadership Watch notes her first public appearance in September 2010, when she attended a photocall for participants of the 3rd Korean Workers’ Party Conference, where she stood among her father’s staff. By the following year, she was a regular member of her father’s entourage, and at Kim Jong-il’s funeral in December 2011, state media revealed her leading senior party officials in bowing at the casket.

Before his death, Kim Jong-il included a “significant and unknown” role for Kim Yo-jong in his succession planning. Madden described her duties under the KJI regime to CNN, calling her

an “advance-team leader”

who inspected sites before official visits and performed administrative duties.

Now, Madden says, she has taken on even more responsibility as a regular fixture by Kim Jong-un’s side, receiving intelligence briefings and contributing to policy. In fact, Madden believes that she played a large part in planning the three officials’ trip to the Asian Games in South Korea. If true, this would suggest that the Kim dynasty is still perfectly intact, and a coup is just one of the many wild theories.

837,"On Friday, Nigerian armed forces chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh announced a ceasefire between President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration and the extremist group Boko Haram. Bedeh claimed the truce, which was widely welcomed, would lay the groundwork for the release of the more than 200 girls who were abducted in April, spurring the explosion of the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.

On Saturday, the supposedly appeased group launched an attack on a town in Adamawa State in eastern Nigeria, capturing 40 women and planting a flag in the town of Wagga. They also beheaded six victims during an assault on Friday, after the ceasefire deal was announced. All of which makes a truce, supposedly negotiated with the “chief of security” of the Boko Haram group and the Nigerian government, seem decidedly shaky.

The ceasefire claims, and Boko Haram’s subsequent actions, have left people in Nigeria scratching their heads, with experts saying the ceasefire may have been a mirage, either a fraud concocted by the government or the middleman who brokered the agreement, whose real-life links to Boko Haram are now in dispute.

Alleged Boko Haram envoy Danladi Ahmadu is now under scrutiny, with many questioning whether he is in fact the group’s chief of security and has the authority to speak on its behalf. During an interview on Friday, Ahmadu didn’t explicitly say that Boko Haram had agreed to a ceasefire, and he did not give details of the girls’ release, Arab News reports. Elders in Borno state in Nigeria’s north-east have publicly said that they believe the government was negotiating with a fraudster, and have yet to talk to the real Boko Haram.

Boko Haram, meanwhile, has not released a public statement about the ceasefire. Rather, they have continued on a weekend campaign of violence, holding running battles with Nigerian security forces, who say that they have yet to receive any word from their superiors ordering them to cease fire in skirmished with the insurgents.

“It is not clear who the said Boko Haram negotiator is, and whether he has the mandate of the entire group or just a faction of the entire group,” Arab News quoted Nnamdi Obasi, senior analyst of Nigeria for Crisis Group, an independent, nongovernmental organization.

Some people think the announcement is a political move by President Jonathan to inspire optimism in voters and win their support, as it’s rumored he will announce his run for re-election in February 2015 over the next few weeks. The government said it has been working on negotiations with Boko Haram for months."
839,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Friday confirmed that the leader of al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-linked organization in Africa, was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Somalia this week.

The leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, was targeted Monday in an airstrike that hit a vehicle and compound in a militant stronghold south of the capital, Mogadishu.

Al-Shabab has been linked to a number of attacks in Africa, including the bloody siege at the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2013 that killed 67 people.

""Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to al-Shabab,"" Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement.

At the time of the strike, the Pentagon said it could not confirm Godane's death.

Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions were used to strike the targets. Both manned aircraft and unmanned drones participated in the attack.

The Pentagon said no U.S. ground troops were involved in the operation.

""The United States works in coordination with its friends, allies and partners to counter the regional and global threats posed by violent extremist organizations,"" Kirby said in the statement released Friday.

The United States has backed the Somali government, which has pushed the terrorist groups out of Mogadishu. Despite the government successes, the terror group has been able to operate in parts of the country that remain out of the reach of the government's influence.

The White House said it would continue to pursue the organization.

""Even as this is an important step forward in the fight against al-Shabab, the United States will continue to use the tools at our disposal –- financial, diplomatic, intelligence and military –- to address the threat that al-Shabaab and other terrorist groups pose to the United States and the American people,"" the White House said in a statement."

Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets believe Apple will sell 19 million Apple Watch units in calendar year 2015, with more than half of those being sold in the December quarter. His prediction was issued in a new note to investors this week, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider.

Bachman is bullish on the Apple Watch, but he believes it will take some time for applications to be built that will truly sell the public on the upcoming wrist-worn device.

His estimates suggest there will be an installed base of more than 484 million iPhone users as of December 2015. Sales of 19 million Apple Watch units would equate to 3.9 percent of the total user base.

For fiscal year 2016, Bachman believes Apple will sell 36.5 million of the Apple Watch, growing to 10.9 percent of iPhone users by September of 2016.

Bachman's confidence in the Apple Watch comes despite the fact that there is still much not known about the wearable. In particular, he's especially curious to find out final pricing, application availability, and battery life.

Regarding the high-end price point, BMO's analyst isn't concerned if the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition sells for more than $10,000. He suspects Apple will sell very few units at that price, as most high-end watch consumers will opt for a brand like Rolex that can stand the test of time.

Bachman also isn't concerned about suspected battery life of around 24 hours. He noted that most consumers have become accustomed to recharging their iPhone at night by their bedside, and he expects Apple Watch users will do the same.

BMO has maintained its price target of $135 for shares of AAPL, along with an ""outperform"" rating."

Since August, the terrorist group overtaking large swathes of Syria and Iraq, has beheaded two more Americans and a Briton in similar displays of barbarism.

887,"Every superhero has an origin story, but one Russian boy’s unbelievable tale isn’t from a comic book — it’s very much real-life.

Twelve-year-old Nikolai Kryaglyachenko was walking home from school one day when he stopped to lean against a lamppost.

Unfortunately for Nikolai, the lamppost had a faulty wire and the schoolboy was blasted across the street by a jolt of electricity.

“When I came round, I felt groggy, but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. When I woke up the next day and got out of bed, I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest,” Nikolai revealed.

Being a comic book fan, Nikolai immediately set about testing his new power, which is eerily similar to the power wielded by Marvel character Magneto.

“I can do things I couldn’t do before, but I don’t have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass — it just moved towards me,” he said.

Naturally, Nikolai’s schoolmates were fascinated by his new power, but what they didn’t know was that he could pass his ability to others, turning them into human magnets, too.

“I could even hang a ladle on my nose,” said classmate Vika Balandina.

Nikolai is not the first real-life Magneto. In fact, an entire Russian family got magnetism superpower in 1987.

A year after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Leonid Tenkaev, his wife, Galina, their daughter Tanya and grandson Kolya were all able to stick metal objects to their bodies, according to The Guardian.

When they discovered their powers, Russian and Japanese scientists examined the family and verified that their seeming magnetism was real.

“There is absolutely no doubt that the objects stick as if their bodies were magnetic,” said Dr. Atusi Kono in 1991.

Another famous real-life Magneto revealed herself at a Superfields conference of 300 “human magnets” in 1990.

“It sounded unbelievable,” the boy’s father, Jason Steward, told the Daily News. He insists his son “didn’t mean anything by it.”

The Stewards had just watched “The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies” days earlier, inspiring Aiden’s imagination and leading him to proclaim that he had in his possession the one ring to rule them all.

“Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly,” Steward said.

Aiden claimed Thursday he could put a ring on his friend's head and make him invisible like Bilbo Baggins, who stole Gollum’s ""precious"" in J.R.R. Tolkien’s fantasy series “The Lord of the Rings.”

“I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence,” the boy's father later wrote in an email. ""If he did, I'm sure he'd bring him right back.""

Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the fourth-grader’s suspension, citing confidentiality policies, according to the Odessa American, who first reported Aiden’s troubles Friday.

The family moved to the Kermit Independent School District only six months ago, but it’s been nothing but headaches for Aiden. He’s already been suspended three times this school year.

Two of the disciplinary actions this year were in-school suspensions for referring to a classmate as black and bringing his favorite book to school: ""The Big Book of Knowledge.""

“He loves that book. They were studying the solar system and he took it to school. He thought his teacher would be impressed,” Steward said.

But the teacher learned the popular children’s encyclopedia had a section on pregnancy, depicting a pregnant woman in an illustration, he explained.

914,"Nope. Argentina’s President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has not become godmother of a Jewish baby to stop him from becoming a werewolf – despite what you may have read in multiple news reports.

Over the past few days, the story has been reported and unquestioningly re-reported across the echo chamber of the internet, picked up by news organisations around the world including Haaretz, Buzzfeed, The Independent and The Huffington Post.

Like all good urban myths, the articles were based on a grain of truth: by tradition, the seventh son (or daughter) born to an Argentine family is eligible to become the godson (or daughter) of the president. Until this month, the honour had only been bestowed on Christian babies, but on Wednesday, Iair Tawil – not a baby, but the strapping 21-year old son of a rabbi – became the country’s first Jewish presidential godson.

In her Twitter account, Kirchner described Tawil, 21, as “completely sweet” and lit Hanukkah candles with his family.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

But somehow, the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón (Argentina’s equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.

Evidently, the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colourful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible – confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behaviour from national leaders in the continent of magical realism.

But according to Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda, there is no link between the two traditions. “The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,” he said.

That custom began in 1907, when Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann, Volga German emigrés from south-eastern Russia asked then-president José Figueroa Alcorta to become godfather to their seventh son, said the historian.

“The couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia, where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons, and Argentina’s president accepted.”

The practice soon became tradition and was passed into law in 1974 by Isabel Perón, the widow of Argentina’s political strongman General Juan Perón, once she succeeded him in the presidential seat after his death in office. As Argentina’s first woman president, Mrs Perón extended the benefit to seventh daughters as well.“The unconnected myth of the lobizón began among Argentina’s “gauchos,” the cowboys of Argentina’s vast cattle-raising Pampas, adapted from the older European werewolf legends,” said Balmaceda.In the Argentinian version, the lobizón transforms into a mixture of pig and dog every Tuesday and Friday night – not just once every full moon. Unlikely other werewolves of myth, the lobizón transmits its curse not through its bite but by passing between the legs of its unfortunate victims.

In Catholic Argentina, large familes are not uncommon: over 120,000 families had seven of more children at last count in 2006. Not all qualify to become presidential god-children as the honour is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively, with no daughters in between.

The president with most godsons was Juan Perón, who had 1,982 over three terms in office. He is followed by another Peronist former president, Carlos Menem, who had 1,136 during the 1990s. Fernández has become presidential godmother to some 700 children since taking office in 2007. Earlier this year, she set another precedent, by making the the daughter of a lesbian couple the first presidential godchild."
917,"Source: Detroit Free Press

Yesterday, we reported on a rumor from Bleeding Cool that someone in Detroit had stolen one of the Batmobiles being used for filming in the city. The rumor took off all over the web, even making its way to Detroit's local CBS affliate. Our article did pretty well, probably because we found that sweet MTV contest video from 1989, showing this plot has been in motion for twenty-five years.

But there's just one problem... it didn't happen. The Detroit Free press checked with police spokesman Michael Woody, who said, ""The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs."" He then exited the room and promptly removed a rubber mask, revealing himself to be The Joker in disguise, and laughed maniacally."

932,"India is going through some serious public sector reforms under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So not turning up for work for a quarter of a century is now not OK, as one civil servant found out recently.

India's Central Public Works Department (CPWD), in a press release dated Jan. 8, 2015, announced the dismissal of a senior electrical engineer employed by the department for 35 years. He only worked the first 10.

It sounds like the CPWD could use a bit of reorganisation. The employee stopped turning up for work in 1990, and an inquiry was launched in 1992. The department then seems to have forgotten about it for 13 years:

Charges were clearly established six years ago, but Verma apparently remained in employment for another eight years until he was sacked today. It's not clear from the press release whether he was paid over the whole period. In 2014, a German civil servant admitted he hadn't done any work in the last 14 years, but Verma beats him by a decade."
934,"Bears might be the #1 threat to America, but what’s the #1 threat to bears? Justin Bieber, apparently.

Here’s the deal: Russian fisherman Igor Vorozhbitsyn was on his way to his favorite fishing spot in Russia’s Yakutia Republic on August 5 when he was attacked by a brown bear. Just then, the 42-year-old’s ringtone, which was set to Bieber’s “Baby,” started blasting, and the ursine predator fled into the woods.

“Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,” a wildlife expert told the Austrian Times.

OK, so the next time I’m attacked by bears, I’ve gotta play some Justin Bieber. But the next time I’m attacked by pirates, I’ve gotta crank that Britney Spears. Got it.

Thanks to JB’s breakout 2010 single, Vorozhbitsyn survived with only cuts and severe bruises to his face and chest, although I don’t think the ordeal has made him a Belieber. “I know that sort of ringtone isn’t to everyone’s taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,” he told the AT. Yep, that story definitely checks out."

985,"The Islamic militant group ISIS beheaded Steven Joel Sotloff, an American freelance journalist who was abducted a year ago in Syria, in a video made public Tuesday by a jihadist monitoring organization.

The monitoring organization, SITE Intel Group, announced on Twitter that Sotloff had been beheaded. It said that ISIS had also threatened to execute a British captive, David Cawthorne Haines.

Last week, Sotloff’s mother, Shirley, pleaded directly with the leader of ISIS to spare her son.

“We have not seen Steven for over a year, and we miss him very much,” she said in a video message to the ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. “We want to see him home safe and sound and to hug him.”

Sotloff, 31, wrote about conflict in the Middle East for Time magazine and other publications. He grew up in Miami and attended the University of Central Florida in the early 2000s. He has a Twitter account, and last posted Aug. 3, 2013, just before he disappeared.

ISIS threatened Sotloff’s life in another video last month. In that video, ISIS beheaded another American journalist, James Foley, and said that it would kill Sotloff, too, unless the United States ended airstrikes against the militant group.

The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said that he could not confirm the authenticity of the Sotloff video. He said that the United States had devoted significant time and resources to rescuing Sotloff. The CIA also said that it could not confirm authenticity."
996,"Widower Stan Beaton cried tears of joy after telephone engineers found the voicemail recording of his late wife he thought was lost forever.

Stan, 68, of Mirfield, was left devastated in December when an upgrade of his phone line by Virgin Media wiped the precious greeting he had kept for 14 years.

The retired forklift truck driver took comfort in the voice of wife Ruby, who died of stomach cancer aged 63 in May, 2003.

Stan had been assured by the phone company that the recording would be saved after the upgrade and the firm was forced to apologise and offered to make donations to Stan’s favourite charities after the blunder.

Red-faced bosses, though, didn’t stop there and put a team of 10 engineers on the case until the recording was recovered.

Stan was overcome with emotion when he was played a recording of the voicemail and said: “I felt pure elation and just couldn’t believe it. I thought the recording was gone forever.

“I can’t thank Virgin Media enough. Putting 10 people on the job must have cost them a fortune. I am staggered by that.”

Stan, who was married to Ruby for 20 years, often used to listen to the voicemail when he was feeling down.

He had previously tried to record the message to ensure it wasn’t lost but said: “All I ended up with were blank tapes.”

Virgin is planning to send a CD of the recording to Stan and the grateful pensioner has a treat for the engineer who finally retrieved the message.

“I’ve got a nice bottle of Glenfiddich with their name on it,” he said."
1002,"Seth Rogen is in early talks to play the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak in a high profile biopic of Steve Jobs, according to the Hollywood Reporter.Christian Bale is in line to play Jobs himself, the famed technology guru who died on 5 October 2011 of cancer. The Oscar-winning writer of Facebook movie The Social Network, Aaron Sorkin, is writing the screenplay for Britain’s Danny Boyle to direct.

Rogen’s appointment is said to be in no way a done deal, especially given that Bale has not yet signed on the dotted line. The Canadian star of This Is the End and Neighbours is best known for his work in comedic fare, and would be taking a rare step into the dramatic spotlight with the untitled biopic.

Sorkin’s take is effectively the “official” Jobs biopic, since it adapts the bestselling official biography of the technology icon, Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography. Isaacson’s book is based on more than 40 interviews with its subject conducted over two years, as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors and colleagues.A rival biopic, titled Jobs, was released in 2013 with Ashton Kutcher as the Apple founder and Josh Gad as Wozniak. It received mostly negative reviews and was not a hit at the box office."
1006,"Google Inc. (GOOGL:US) bought six office buildings northwest of its Silicon Valley headquarters from Starwood Capital Group LLC and Blackstone Group LP (BX:US) in a $585 million deal, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

The properties are part of the Pacific Shores Center office park in Redwood City, California, about 11 miles (18 kilometers) from Google’s main office in Mountain View, said the people, who asked not to be named because the transaction is private. The company said in its quarterly report filed yesterday that it bought land and buildings for $585 million, without details.

The acquisition extends a real estate deal spree as Google, owner of the world’s largest search engine, expands hiring and makes acquisitions. This month, the company signed office-lease agreements for a total commitment of about $1 billion through 2028, according to the filing.

“We expect to continue to hire aggressively for the remainder of 2014,” Google said in the filing. “Acquisitions will also remain an important component of our strategy.”

The company had 55,030 full-time employees as of Sept. 30, up almost 19 percent from a year earlier, the filing shows.

Meghan Casserly, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment beyond the filing. Tom Johnson, a spokesman for Barry Sternlicht’s Starwood Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Peter Rose, a spokesman for New York-based Blackstone, declined to comment. The Silicon Valley Business Journal reported this month that Google was close to completing a deal at the site.

The properties Google purchased comprise about 934,200 square feet (86,800 square meters) of Class A office space, as well as a 38,000-square-foot fitness center that includes a gym, pool and spa, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. That’s more than half of the 1.7 million square feet of office space at the complex.

The office building addresses are 1200, 1300, 1600, 1700, 1800, and 1900 Seaport Blvd., the people said.

Pacific Shores Center is a 106-acre (43-hectare) waterfront campus that was developed by San Francisco-based Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s. It lies about halfway between San Francisco and San Jose. The campus, which includes sports fields and a park, is next to restored wetlands that are part of the San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge.

Starwood Capital bought Pacific Shores Center in December 2006, near the height of the commercial-property market, from its developer and Walton Street Capital LLC, and immediately resold two of the buildings. Starwood Capital paid about $833 million in the deal, its first office acquisition in the San Francisco Bay area.

Blackstone in 2011 bought an $80 million junior loan on the office complex at a discount in an effort to gain ownership if Starwood Capital defaulted, two people with knowledge of the purchase said at the time. Blackstone then gained an equity stake in the properties sold to Google through a loan restructuring.

Blackstone, through its Equity Office unit, has major office holdings in Northern California and is the second-largest U.S. office landlord, after Brookfield Property Partners LP."

1015,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Research Medical Center is waiting for test results after concern that a patient might have a contagious disease.  The hospital says some local reports that the patient has Ebola are false.

Research Medical Center says that patient came to its Brookside campus emergency department Saturday for treatment.

“Somebody went to an ER with a high fever and a history of having recently been to Nigeria,” said Jeff Hershberger, the spokesman for the KCMO Health Department.

He says because Ebola is so high-profile right now, they don’t want to rule it out quite yet.

“The patient has been isolated, however, at this point, because there’s been no development of new symptoms, it’s highly unlike that Ebola is the diagnosis,” added Hershberger.

According to a statement from Research Medical Center, like hospitals across the United States, it has standard infectious disease precautions and is well-equipped and well-prepared to implement them as necessary.

“There’s a wide umbrella of things that it could be,” Hershberger said, “We want to make sure, looking at that entire umbrella, that we are not ignoring something.”

The hospital does not believe the patient has Ebola, and says the patient is being treated for another illness. Hershberger says regardless, Ebola should not be a big concern.

“It’s very unlikely they will even be exposed to it, let alone contract it,” Hershberger said, “You cannot catch Ebola unless you touch the bodily fluids of somebody who has Ebola.”

The health department says it should know the patient’s diagnosis by Monday. It also says that Research Medical Center is taking the appropriate steps when it comes to dealing with infectious diseases."

1082,"We're at a loss for words right now. Our hearts are completely broken by this news.
17-year-old transgender teen Leelah Alcorn, also known as Joshua Alcorn, was killed after being struck by a tractor-trailer on a highway in Ohio around 2:30 a.m.
The death, however, was NOT accidental.
Leelah took her own life and detailed exactly why she was killing herself in a lengthy and heart-shattering suicide note posted to her tumblr page.
[ Related: Salvation Army Documents Show LGBTQ Discrimination ]
After explaining to her followers why exactly they were seeing the note, she revealed she took her own life because she was never accepted for being transgender.
Especially from her family.
Some of the more gut-wrenching parts of her note are as follows:
""When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self. That's exactly what it did to me….
When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.
I formed a sort of a ""fuck you"" attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted…
I have decided I've had enough. I'm never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I'm never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I'm never going to find a man who loves me. I'm never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There's no winning…
That's the gist of it, that's why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that's not a good enough reason for you, it's good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don't give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights.
Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say ""that's fucked up"" and fix it. Fix society. Please.""

1107,"BEIRUT: A statement attributed to the Islamic State group claimed an American female hostage was killed in a Jordanian airstrike on Friday on the outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, the extremist group's main stronghold.

The statement identified the woman as Kayla Jean Mueller and said she was killed during Muslim prayers - which usually take place around midday on Fridays - in airstrikes that targeted ""the same location for more than an hour.""

No Islamic State militants were killed in the airstrikes, the statement further claimed.

It published photos allegedly of the bombed site, showing a severely damaged brown colored three-story building - but no images of the woman.

American officials said they were looking into the report, and the White House said it did not have immediate comment. There was also no immediate comment from the Jordanian government.

The IS statement could not be independently verified. It appeared on a militant website commonly used by IS and was also distributed by IS-affiliated Twitter users.

Mueller, of Prescott, Arizona, had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees, according to a 2013 article in The Daily Courier, her hometown newspaper. The 26-year-old told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria.

""For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,"" she said. ""It's important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.""

According to the local paper, Mueller had been working with the humanitarian aid agency Support to Life, as well as a local NGO that helped female Syrian refugees develop skills.

A 2007 article about Mueller from the same local newspaper said she was a student at Northern Arizona University and was active in the Save Darfur Coalition.

On Sunday, President Barack Obama said the U.S. was ""deploying all the assets that we can"" to find Mueller.

""We are in very close contact with the family trying to keep them updated,"" he said in an interview with NBC's Today Show. ""Obviously this is something that is heart-breaking for the family and we want to make sure we do anything we can to make sure that any American citizen is rescued from this situation.""

Her identity had not been disclosed out of fears for her safety.

If her death is confirmed, she would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the Islamic State militants. Three other Americans, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group.

Jordan, which is part of a U.S.-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria, stepped up its attacks after IS announced it had killed a captive Jordanian pilot. The Syrian government said Thursday that dozens of Jordanian fighter jets had bombed Islamic State training centers and weapons storage sites. It did not say where the attacks occurred.

There was no word from the Jordanian government on whether its planes had struck Raqqa on Friday. But activists who monitor the Syrian conflict from inside the country said U.S.-led coalition planes hit several targets on the edges and outskirts of Raqqa, in quick succession on Friday."
1109,"The first group of mass graves excavated on the outskirts of a town in Mexico’s Guerrero state does not contain the bodies of any of the 43 students who went missing last month, Mexico’s attorney general said. The whereabouts of the students, who disappeared after a confrontation with police in late September, have been the subject of mass protests in the state.

Authorities have been conducting DNA tests on the 28 badly burned bodies found in the graves since discovering them earlier this month. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said tests were continuing on four additional graves uncovered last week.

State governor Angel Aguirre said some of the bodies could have been earlier victims of criminal gangs, and some of them seemed to have been buried “months ago.”

Murillo Karam, speaking at a news conference Tuesday, added that 14 additional police officers were arrested over the disappearances. So far, 50 people, mostly police, have been arrested for their roles in the incident, and prosecutors accuse police of colluding with a local gang known as Guerreros Unidos. The police chief and mayor of Iguala, the town where the confrontation between police and students occurred, have also been accused of ties with the gang. Both are currently in hiding.

On Tuesday, the leader of Guerreros Unidos, Benjamin Mondragon, committed suicide by shooting himself when confronted by security forces in the neighboring state of Morelos. Federal authorities said it wasn’t clear whether Mondragon was involved with the student disappearances.

Hundreds of protesters, many from the teachers’ college that the missing students had attended, took to the streets in Guerrero’s capital of Chilpancingo this week over the disappearances. The protests turned chaotic on Tuesday when demonstrators overtook state government buildings, ransacked offices and burned parts of the complex. On Tuesday, they took over bank branches and a local radio station and vowed to keep up the pressure on Guerrero’s government until the missing students were found."
1131,"Yes, we've known for a while that Christian Bale might be the next actor to portray Steve Jobs, but Variety now seems mighty sure: the publication is reporting that our favorite Batman will indeed play our favorite technology pitchman in Sony's new movie.

Mind you, Variety technically says that Bale is merely ""in talks,"" but the rest of the article seems pretty certain that it's a done deal.

In case you've forgotten, Sony's film is the one penned by Aaron Sorkinwho also wrote the scripts for The Social Network and Moneyball) is directed by Danny Boyle (remember Slumdog Millionaire?) and is actually based on Walter Issacson's official biography of Steve Jobs. In other words, it's shaping up to be a class act. Maybe it'll be enough to wash away memories of that other Jobs film. [Variety]"
1133,"Afghan news publication Khaama Press has reported that a woman and her family have killed 25 Taliban fighters in the western Farah province of the country. The woman, Reza Gul, was apparently acting in retaliation for the murder of her son, who was a police officer. Gul claimed to have been awoken by gunfire near her home, where her son was working at a police outpost. When she investigated the situation, she found her son dead.

""It was around 5 a.m. when my son's check post came under the attack of Taliban,"" Gul said to TOLOnews. ""When the fighting intensified, I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon, went to the check post and began shooting back.""

Many of Gul's family members joined the fight against the Taliban, which reportedly lasted several hours. Gul's husband Abdul Satar explained how the family was committed to holding off the Taliban militants from the area where the fighting began.

""My young son who was a police officer was killed in front of my eyes. I pulled aside his dead body and started fighting to defend my soil to prove that this is the soil of Malalay, the hero. I was committed to give up my life, but not my son's check post.""

General Abdul Razaq Yaqubi, Police Chief in Afghanistan's Farah province, praised the family for their efforts in holding off the Taliban with the following statement: ""We are proud of the bravery of this family and this is a saga that will be remembered for long by police and residents of Farah province.""

1152,"Is Kim Jong Un's sister running North Korea?

That's the latest question on the minds of North Korea watchers amid a storm of rumors that have built up in the weeks since Kim's last public appearance on Sept. 3. Other rumors suggest he is being treated for gout and that he has been hospitalized due to a cheese allergy.

With so little hard news leaking out of the Hermit Kingdom, it's impossible to confirm any of this — including the rumor that Kim's little sister, Kim Yo Jong, is the new show-runner. But there is evidence that she has upped her political profile over the past few years, and she may be one of the few people on the planet with direct access to North Korea's leader. Here's what we've been able to mine.

The two were born to Ko Yong Hui, a mistress of former North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Il. Kim Jong Un was the middle child of this relationship, second to an older brother, while Kim Yo Jong is the former supreme leader's youngest child.

Image: RIA Novosti, Dmitry Astakhov, Presidential Press Service/Associated Press

The pair grew up in Ko Yong Hui's residence in Pyongyang as well as in Switzerland, where they both attended school for some time, and have a ""very good relationship,"" Michael Madden, who operates a blog called North Korea Leadership Watch, told Mashable. At one point, the two appeared in the same school recital.

She may have started working for the Korean Workers Party, the political establishment of which Kim Jong Un is the leader, around 2008, when her dad still ran the country. She reportedly worked to clear the way for her older brother to succeed her father once he died, though that's about all we know about their relationship.

Kim Yo Jong was born on Sept. 26, 1987. By the time she was eight she was off to Berne, Switzerland, to attend school near where her older brothers were doing the same.

She came back to North Korea roughly four years later, but not much is known about her activities until 2008, when she began to participate in the country's politics.

“She was one of the only ones that was distinctly interested in politics, in North Korean politics,"" Madden said. Her father, according to Madden, used to go around telling his friends about his daughter's sharp political mind.

— North Korea (@NorthKoreaNews1) October 7, 2014

Like many things about Kim Yo Jong and North Korea in general, her role in politics isn't clear.

She may have started working for her father or her aunt back in 2008 as a ""junior"" member of the party, according to NK Leadership Watch. When succession plans were finalized for her father's eventual passing, the powers that be reportedly gave her a significant part to play, possibly a position within her dad's personal secretariat or on the National Defense Commission.

She became a member of her father's inner circle by 2011, and that carried over to her brother's inner circle when Kim Jong Un took the reins later that year.

“She can get [Kim Jong Un] on the telephone, she can see him in person, that kind of thing,"" Madden said.

NK Leadership Watch has written that Kim Yo Jong plans her brother's appearances, ""including his itineraries, schedule, logistical needs and security arrangements."" This past March state media reportedly listed her as a senior official within the party — a first, according to the blog.

It's not much to go on, but Madden said that reports of turmoil at the top in North Korea are probably exaggerated. This is less likely to be a coup — and more likely, he said, that Kim Yo Jong is relaying her brother's orders while he takes a break.

But that doesn't mean the world should take their eyes off the little sister.

“Kim Jong Un is not a micromanager,"" Madden said. ""It’s very possible she could be running a lot more things than we think.”

1166,"On Friday, the Nigerian military reportedly agreed to a truce with the militant group Boko Haram. According to the announcement, more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls who were abducted this year will be freed. According to CNN, the details of the release are expected to be negotiated next week.

In August, the militant group Boko Haram declared an ""Islamic state"" in northeastern Nigeria, a territory largely occupied by the fighters. Boko Haram is believed to be hiding the girls somewhere in this area.

This week marked six months since the mass kidnapping took place. Here's what has happened since.

On April 14, 276 Nigerian girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants from a school in Chibok, northern Nigeria, according to official figures. The mass abduction occurred at night, and it took days before the full scale of the kidnapping became clear. Shortly after the abductions, a military spokesperson claimed that most of the girls had been rescued by Nigerian soldiers, but the remarks turned out to be wrong. Whether or not the Nigerian army is suited to finding the girls has been questioned: Its reputation in the rural north is bad, and it is often accused of lacking transparency and its soldiers of committing crimes. One recent video allegedly showed Nigerian soldiers slitting prisoners' throats, according to Amnesty International.

In the weeks following the mass kidnapping, criticism of the Nigerian government and the military had quickly grown as they failed to free the girls. In May, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau released a video message claiming that the girls would ""remain slaves with us.""

Nearly 200 days have passed since the girls were abducted, and according to estimates, more than 200 schoolgirls are still being held by Boko Haram militants.

Only a few dozen girls have managed to escape over the past months: The Times of London cited an example of four girls who were able to flee from their captors and walked for three weeks through the jungle. Most of the escapes, however, took place shortly after the abductions, as this graph shows. As time passed, hope faded for many parents, and reports of escapes became less frequent. ""The longer they're there, the greater likelihood they become dispersed, and the more difficult they are to track down,"" Jennifer Cook, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Time magazine this week, before the reports emerged that Boko Haram was considering freeing them. There are conflicting numbers of how many girls are still in captivity — some say 215, some say 219.

The numbers used in our graph only refer to the mass kidnapping in April. Other abductions of women and girls have occurred since.

Boko Haram is predominantly active in the northeast of Nigeria, where the girls were kidnapped, but its sphere of influence extends further into the west and south of the country.

The militants have conducted an increasing number of attacks over the past few months and are now believed to be active in an area which could be up to 500,000 square kilometers, or 193,000 square miles. Its core area spreads over as much as 250,000 square kilometers, roughly the size of the United Kingdom. However, Boko Haram is not in full control of most of the areas in which it is active.

Fatalities from non-criminal Nigerian violence — a term that includes attacks by terror groups and communal or political actors — have risen rapidly since 2010, and Boko Haram attacks are the main driver behind this rise. The militant group has killed at least 5,100 Nigerians this year, according to estimates of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. This graph shows how fatalities caused by Boko Haram went up from around zero to more than 5,000 annually within only six years.

Although the threat posed by Boko Haram had grown steadily, it took until the April abductions for the conflict to make international headlines. The burst of reporting was accompanied by a huge rise in attention to Boko Haram on social media.

Up until May 13, about 3.3 million tweets were posted, using the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. According to the BBC, most people who used the hashtag lived in Nigeria (27 percent) and the United States (26 percent). Still, thousands of tweets are being posted each week in an effort to raise awareness about the fate of the Nigerian schoolgirls.

The social media campaign found prominent supporters: As of Oct. 17, more than 57,000 users had retweeted Michelle Obama's message: ""Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families. It's time to #BringBackOurGirls.""

The Obama administration deployed 80 U.S. military personnel to Chad in May. In a letter, the White House said: ""These personnel will support the operation of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft for missions over northern Nigeria and the surrounding area,"" and aid in the search for the missing schoolgirls. Chad is east of Nigeria. Other countries, such as China, France and Britain, have also sent military assistance to the region.

According to some reports, Boko Haram started to sell some of the kidnapped girls as brides to militants in May. The value of a girl, according to Boko Haram: $12. The Associated Press cited reports of forced mass weddings which had taken place after the abductions. In a video message, Boko Haram leader Shekau had reportedly announced: ""I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah.""

The hunt for Boko Haram leader Shekau had started well before the mass abductions of the girls. In 2013, the U.S. State Department added Shekau to its ""Rewards for Justice Program,"" offering up to $7 million for information that led to his capture. Those efforts have been unsuccessful. A video which was released this month showed Shekau alive and in freedom.

Meanwhile, USAID — the international development agency of the United States — has devoted about $150 million to programs aimed at providing education to Nigerian children and teenagers.

The programs primarily target internally displaced children and others who are affected by the violence in Nigeria. Only 28 percent of primary-age children have ever attended school in Borno, the state in which the kidnappings took place.

The low attendance rates in an area partially under the sphere of influence of Boko Haram does not seem to be a coincidence. Boko Haram's name can be translated as ""Western education is sin."""
1202,"Officials are using 'very sophisticated voice-identification technology' to home in on the masked extremist who carried out the murder of the American journalist, said Peter Westmacott, British ambassador to the U.S. A prime suspect is Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a 23-year-old London rapper who left his family a year ago to fight with the Islamist fanatics.

Authorities are close to identifying the black-clad Islamic State jihadist who beheaded an American journalist — and a prime suspect is a British-born rapper who left his parent’s million-dollar home last year to fight in Syria.

The British ambassador to the United States, Peter Westmacott, said Sunday that officials are using high-tech voice recognition tools to zero in on the masked fanatic who carried out the brutal murder of American journalist James Foley.

“We are close,” Westmacott said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “There is some very sophisticated voice-identification technology and other measures that we have got which should allow us to be very clear about who this person is before very long.”

British newspapers reported Sunday that investigators were looking at several home-grown jihadists. The prime suspect is Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a 23-year-old London rapper, who left his family’s $1 million home a year ago to fight with the Islamist fanatics and once posted a Twitter photo of himself holding a severed head, The Sunday Times reported.

He is one of six children of Abdel Abdul Bary, an Egyptian militant who is facing terrorism charges in connection with Al Qaeda’s twin 1998 bombings at the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, the son of an Egyptian militant who is facing terrorism charges, went from rapping to posing with guns as a fighter for ISIS.

After spending years in and out of Egyptian prisons, subjected to torture, the elder Bary and his wife Ragaa were granted political asylum in Britain in 1993. He was arrested for the bombings in 1998 and was extradited to the United States in 2012 after a protracted legal battle.

Ragaa’s story is told in the book, “Shadow Lives: The Forgotten Woman of the War on Terror.”

The younger Bary rapped under the name L Jinny or Lyricist Jinn Matic, and his songs had been featured on the BBC’s Radio 1 Extra, media outlets reported.

In one freestyle posted on his Facebook page, he raps about being addicted to alcohol and “the rock.”

“I swear the day when they came and took my dad, I could have killed a couple too . . . Imagine back then I was only six, picture what I’d do now with a loaded stick . . . violate my brothers and I’m filling you with lead.”

In July 2013, he posted on Facebook, “The Unknown mixtape with my bro tabanacle will be the last music I’m ever releasing. I have left everything for the sake of Allah.”

On Aug. 13, he tweeted a photo of himself in Ragga, Iraq, holding a severed head and the caption “Chilllin’ with my homie or what’s left of him,” The Times of London reported. His Twitter account was suspended soon afterward.

Bary also tweeted a threat in June: “The lions are coming for you soon you filthy kuffs (infidels). Beheadings in your own backyard soon,” according to the Sunday Times.

In March, The Daily Mail reported that Bary claimed on Twitter he and another British jihadist were kidnapped, tortured and robbed by members of a rival terrorist group.

ISIS hostages referred to him and several other militants with British accents as “the Beatles.”

The black-masked man who beheaded Foley in a video posted to YouTube on Tuesday had a distinct British accent.

Some 500 Brits have traveled to the Middle East to join the terrorist group, Westmacott said, calling it “a betrayal of all that we stand for.”

Federal officials have estimated that at least 100 Americans could be fighting with Sunni extremists who have seized territory throughout western Syria and northwestern Iraq.

U.S. lawmakers joined in sounding the alarm about the threat from the radicalized jihadists — especially the many foreign fighters with American and European passports who could easily travel to the West.

“They are one plane ticket away from U.S. shores,” Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on “Meet the Press.”

He said the number of militants with Western documents is “much higher” than the estimate of 2,000 that has been reported.

“They get new recruits every single day,” he said. “If that's a British citizen, we believe it was ... that individual goes back home and . . . buys one plane ticket, they’re in the United States,"" said Rogers. “We may or may not know who that individual is. That's what's so dangerous about this, and why we can't let them continue unabated.”

Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the militants “present the greatest threat we’ve seen since 9/11.”

“This has been festering for the last year and now it’s culminating with the killing and the beheading of an American journalist, which I think is a turning point,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“The American people — it has sort of opened their eyes to what ISIS really is, the true character of ISIS, how savage they really are, and their intent to harm Americans.”

The FBI and Homeland Security Department issued a bulletin to local law enforcement Friday saying there are no specific or credible threats to U.S. soil from the militant group in retaliation for intensified airstrikes in Iraq.

The charity said the dog was found on Friday evening tied to railings at Ayr railway station along with a suitcase full of his belongings, which included a pillow, a toy, a food bowl, and food.

The charity added: “The 2–3-year-old Shar-Pei cross is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.”

Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said:

The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.

We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.

This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about.

Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible. If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.

Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home."
1249,"MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Nicaragua’s government said Sunday that a loud boom heard overnight by residents of the capital was made by a small meteorite that left a crater in a wooded area near the city’s airport.

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event confirmed it was a “relatively small” meteorite that “appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.”

Murillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.

The crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 12 meters (39 feet) and a depth of 5 meters (16 feet), said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.

Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.

“It could have come off that asteroid, because it is normal for that to occur. We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,” he said.

Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was “very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.”

Local residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn’t see anything strange in the sky.

“I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,” Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.

The site of the crater is near Managua’s international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it.

1257,"A woman in China is facing jail time for slicing off her 3-year-old nephew’s penis in anger.

Xue Paan was babysitting her nephew, 3-year-old Qiang Qiang, while Qiang’s mother – Paan’s sister – went to visit neighbors nearby.

Reports indicate that Paan was sitting on the toilet texting her boyfriend when the toddler burst into the bathroom and asked if he could play games on her smart phone.

The toddler’s question reportedly sent Paan into such a rage that she went to the kitchen, grabbed a blunt knife, and completely severed the screaming child’s penis.

The 37-year-old woman then allegedly fled the scene. Qiang’s mother heard his screams and rushed back the apartment.

“I had popped out to see a neighbor and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream,” Qiang’s mother said.

Inquisitr reports that the child had apparently fainted and was lying in a pool of his own blood when his mother arrived; a knife was next to his severed penis.

Qiang’s mother recalls that she “couldn’t believe what I saw.”

The young boy was rushed to the hospital, where surgeons managed to reattach his penis. He was then sent to a specialist in Beijing.

A hospital spokesperson told reporters that, although the boy’s penis was reattached, “it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment. However, he has now had three surgeries, all of which have been successful, and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.”

Paan was arrested. She admitted to attacking the boy because she was angry that “he had interrupted her on the toilet.”

The rumor from iGen.fr claims that Cook was speaking to employees at a retail store in Berlin where he told them that the wears his Apple Watch everywhere, “even in the shower.”
It should be kept in mind though that when the Apple Watch was unveiled last year the company had only said that the device was good for wearing in the rain, getting sweaty during a workout and washing hands. There was no mention of showers or swimming pools.
While it is possible that Apple has tweaked the watch enough that its now good for those tasks as well, one can’t discount the possibility that Cook might simply have been misheard, so we’ll really have to wait until the device arrives to find out just how resistant it is to water.
The Apple Watch will start shipping to customers in April.

1300,"A 9-year-old Texas boy was suspended from school after threatening to use his “Hobbit” ring to make another student disappear, his father says.

Officials at Kermit Elementary School in Winkler County, Texas, said Aiden Steward made a terroristic threat when he told another classmate that he could make him vanish using a ring from the fictional Mount Doom from J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth legendarium, the boy’s father, Jason Steward, told the New York Daily News.

The principal said threats, real or imagined, to another child’s safety would not be tolerated, Mr. Steward said.

“It sounded unbelievable,” Mr. Steward said, insisting his son “didn’t mean anything by it.”

The Stewards had just watched “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies” days earlier.

“Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly,” Mr. Steward told the Daily News. “I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence.”

Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the 4th grader’s suspension, citing confidentiality policies, according to the Odessa American, which first reported the story.

Mr. Steward said he requested a written explanation from the school as to how his son’s statements constituted a “terroristic threat” and was told the school would put the letter in the mail.

The Stewards moved to the Kermit Independent School District only six months ago, and Aiden has already been suspended from school three times.

Two of the disciplinary actions this year were in-school suspensions for referring to a classmate as “black” and for bringing in his favorite children’s book that included a chapter on pregnancy, the Daily News reported.

“He loves that book. They were studying the solar system, and he took it to school. He thought his teacher would be impressed,” Mr. Steward told the paper."

In 1995 Adelaide residents Casey Dean, 14, and his mate Eduard Nitz, 13, stopped off at their local McDonald’s to pick up some burgers.

Among them was a Quarter Pounder with cheese they’d bought for another kid. That kid never turned up, but they didn’t eat his burger . Ever.

Now the boys have become men and the burger has turned 20.

The last McDonald's cheeseburger ever sold in Iceland is still going strong and mould-free – six years after it was bought by a burger-lover.

""Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle but I didn't realize that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realized that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex,"" Khoza reportedly said.

Khoza is sticking with the story that he never planned to release the video of him and his girlfriend of less than two months, and that he has no idea how it ended up on the Internet in the first place, which is all well and good except now he can't use his penis. He reportedly must now pee from a tube and undergo surgery.

Still, Khoza won't press charges: ""Even if I press charges it is useless because it won't bring back my manhood,"" Khoza said. ""Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts.""

Dornella Conner says she was at a gas station in the St Louis suburb in a car being driven by her boyfriend when an officer fired a non-lethal ‘bean bag’ round at them as they tried to drive away, showering her with glass

Police, who were responding to reports of gunshots in the area, said that the officer fired at the car because it was being driven towards him and he feared for his safety – but Conner claims that he had no need to use a weapon on them.

She told Kmov.com: ‘I didn’t have any weapons, I wasn’t looting or anything. I was just out with my boyfriend. We was just riding around respecting Mike Brown.’

Conner told the news channel that several police vehicles had blocked their exit from the gas station ‘from the side and the back’.

A non-lethal bean-bag round

A bean-bag round, or flexible baton round, is a projectile used by law enforcement officers to incapacitate suspects without killing them.

They are fired from a shotgun and take the form of lead shots housed in a small 'pillow'.

They are designed not to penetrate skin, but are capable of causing muscle spasms.

Deaths from bean bag rounds are rare. They have killed people in the past by causing internal bleeding, breaking the neck and even fatally damaging the heart by sending pieces of broken rib into it.

Shotguns with bean-bag rounds are normally colored bright orange to prevent lethal rounds being loaded.

Conner’s father, Donnell, said he was ‘very disappointed at police tactics’. He added: ‘There was no reason to fire upon an innocent person who was sitting in a vehicle.’

Her sister, who goes by the name Tikal Goldie, said: ‘I really just want to have closure and justice for my sister.’

Meanwhile, dozens of people have interrupted holiday shopping at major retail stores around the St. Louis area to speak out about a grand jury's decision not to indict the officer who fatally shot Michael Brown.

The protests began Thanksgiving night and continued early Friday. Protesters spent a few minutes at each store, shouting inside as law enforcement stood watch. There was no immediate word of any arrests.

According to Johnetta Elzie, who had been tweeting and posting videos of the protests, demonstrations occurred at a Wal-Mart and Target in Brentwood, two Wal-Marts in St. Charles and one Wal-Mart in Manchester.

In Ferguson, where Brown was shot on August 9, it was a quiet holiday night. There were no visible protests as the National Guard patrolled the area.

Earlier thousands of Walmart employees threatened to walk out from stores across the country on the biggest shopping day of the year.

Days after a grand jury decided not to charge officer Darren Wilson, demonstrators have led a campaign not to visit stores the day after Thanksgiving.

The group has used hashtags on social media such as #HandsUpDon'tSpend, in reference to the death of the teen in August, and #BlackOutBlackFriday.

Some demonstrators showed up outside Macy's in New York as crowds gathered to get an early jump on the sales.

Others in Ferguson walked through a Target store with their hands up, as unrest continued followed the controversial decision earlier this week.

1378,"ISIS militants are just one mile from Baghdad. The march into the largest city in the country comes on the heels of President Barack Obama admitting that the threat of the group was “underestimated.” The fighting near the city has become fierce, as reports from inside the Middle East region maintain the Islamic State fighters are just about to reach the doorstep of Baghdad.

The ISIS fighters have already garnered a large portion of both Iraq and Syria, but some experts fear that a takeover by the Islamic State in Baghdad could prove “disastrous” for the United States. Thwarting the reach of the group could prove significantly more difficult if Baghdad, with a population of about 7 million, falls under the complete control of ISIS.

“The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has,” Canon Andrew White, a priest leading the only Anglican church in the Iraq city, said.

“Obama says he overstated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to here a very short while to know that they can do very, very, little,” The Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East member added.

Islamic State militants took over the control of Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq. Massive fighting is still ongoing in Fallujah – a town about 25 miles away from Bagdad. BBC News is reporting that Iraqi troops are fighting ISIS militants approximately six miles away from Baghdad. If reports from the news agency are accurate, the Iraqi Army could “barely contain” the ISIS fighters or force a retreat even with the airstrikes offered by the United States.

During the 60 Minutes interview, President Obama had this to say about ISIS and the turmoil in the Middle East.

“During the chaos of the Syrian civil war, where essentially you had huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned, they [ISIS] were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos. [ISIS is] sort of a hybrid of not just the terrorist network, but one with territorial ambitions, and some of the strategy and tactics of an army.”

According to Obama administration military advisers, ISIS now numbers about 40,000 fighters – all of which have sworn allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his plan to create an Islamic caliphate.

1381,"The NHL may be set to expand in a big, big way.

Sports Business News reported late Tuesday the league is preparing to add four teams by 2017 in Toronto, Quebec City, Seattle and Las Vegas.

Expansion fees could reach a combined $1.4 billion.

The number of NHL teams would increase to 34, including nine Canadian clubs.

Earlier Tuesday, a report in the Vancouver Province, citing sources close to the situation, said an expansion team in Sin City was a “done deal” and the only thing yet to be determined is who will front the ownership group.

The report also indicated any expansion plans might include more than two teams.

In May, Las Vegas officials broke ground on the building of a 20,000-seat multi-sport arena to be completed in spring 2016.

Construction on a $400 million, 18,000-seat arena in Quebec City is underway with a projected opening date of Sept. 2015. The rink is being built as part of a public-private partnership between the city and Quebecor Media, owner of QMI Agency, Sun Media and Sun News Network.The league has routinely denied any plans for expansion in recent years.

In spite of that, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly have reportedly had several meetings with city officials and potential ownership groups in Seattle.

Bettman has in the past admitted to receiving interest from groups in Seattle, Las Vegas, Kansas City and Quebec City.

“We’re listening, and that’s all we’re doing,” Bettman said in March. “We haven’t decided to engage in a formal expansion process at this point, but we’re listening. There is a lot of interest, and some of that’s a testament to the state of the game right now.”

The league last expanded in 2000 with the addition of the Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild."

One worker can operate as up to 100 unique users. 

Accompany the photo on some sites is an alleged price list for boosting your app ranking. Getting into the top 10 free apps costs RMB 70,000 (US$11,200), and keeping it there will cost you another RMB 405,000 (US$65,000) per week. The third column is said to be the monthly fee. Negotiations take place over the QQ messaging service.

While Apple has taken steps to counter the manipulation of App Store rankings, it's quite difficult to identify manual downloads as being fake.

1385,"A DESPERATE mother was tricked into feasting on cooked meat from the body of her son by Islamic State militants, it has been claimed.

The famished Kurdish mother had gone to plead with the jihadists to release her son.

Cruel militants delayed talks with the elderly mum – feeding her a meal made with the corpse of her offspring while she waited.

The depraved story was relayed by a brave Briton fighting on the front line with Kurdish forces against the Islamic State, also referred to as IS, ISIS and ISIL.

Yasir Abdulla left behind his wife and children at their Yorkshire home for six months to battle for his Kurdish homeland.

The 36-year-old said the disturbing story was the cause of his hatred against IS – and one of the reasons he has vowed to return to his war-ravaged native county and ""finish the job"".

The father-of-four told The Sun: ""I hate IS because of what happened to an old Kurdish woman from a nearby tribe.

""Her son was captured by IS fighters and taken as a prisoner to Mosul. She was determined to find her son and went to IS headquarters and asked to see him.

""The IS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

""They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were so kind.

But security guard Mr Abdulla then adds: ""They had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, 'You've just EATEN him'.""

""They burn people alive, they chop off people's heads, there is no limit to their depravity.

""They are not Muslims, they have hijacked Islam. All they do is hate.""

The shocking account is just the latest in a string of disturbing executions and punishments administered by the immoral group.

In February, IS released a highly-choreographed propaganda film showing Jordanian fighter pilot Lieutenant Mouath al-Kasaesbeh soaked in fuel and being burned alive inside a cage.

Another video from the organisation showed a man believed to be gay thrown from a seven-storey building. The 50-year-old man, who was blindfolded throughout his sickening fall, is seen to be still alive after hitting the ground below.

He was later stoned to his death by a waiting mob.

Some have interpreted the perceived increase in brutality from the Islamic State as a sign of their weakness.

The terror organisation have suffered a number of defeats recently, including the loss of two strongholds in Iraq.

Last week, Kurdish gunmen stormed the town of Tel Hamis and fought back control from Islamic State rebels.

The group, aided by US-led coalition airstrikes, previously won back the seized border town of Kobani.

Infamous Islamic State militant Jihadi John, who is believed to have orchestrated the beheadings of dozens of hostages, was last week unmasked as a hypocritical cannabis smoker from west London.

Fearless Mr Abdulla, speaking after temporarily returning to his family home in Keighley, West Yorkshire, said: ""IS are very good at making people scared.

""If they make one person scared then that person will make another person scared and soon everyone is scared of IS.

""But the Kurds are not scared of them. Someone has to stand and fight. We have got thousands of people in many villages and towns behind us.

""If we fall then all of those places fall, and that can't happen. The Peshmerga [Military forces of Iraqi Kurdistan] can't wait to take the fight to IS.

""We know we can win."""

1388,"A homeless man who became a YouTube sensation after he spent a $100 donation on food for his beggar friends has received a surprise meal, makeover and hotel stay in a new video released amid claims it is a hoax.

The short film posted by 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin shows Thomas, a man living on the streets of California, being taken to a sushi restaurant before staying in a hotel room complete with a hot tub on Christmas Eve.

After a night's sleep the filmmaker then takes him to a hairdressers for a haircut and then to a mall where he buys a new suit.

The videos, that have gained more than 26million views, are part of a campaign to raise more than $120,000, via an Indiegogo page for Thomas to get his life back on track.

But now, viewers have questioned its authenticity, citing a number of apparent flaws in the footage, as well as the hefty profit Paler Lin has reportedly made from its success - up to a huge $52,000.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS

Smartened up: In Josh Paler Lin's newsest video, homeless Thomas, who became an internet hit after spending a $100 donation on food for his friends, is given a new suit and a makeover

Comfort: After living on the streets of Los Angeles, he is also seen spreading out on the white sheets of the bed in his luxury hotel room

Luxurious: He is also shocked to find that the accommodation comes with an enormous hot tub

While sitting in his luxury hotel room in the new clip, Paler Lin asks Thomas what he would do with $100,000.

In line with the gesture to his homeless friends in his first videos, he says: 'When I come into some money I am going to go to three shelters that helped me out and I am going to buy a bunch of bus tickets for people.

'This is what these people need. They've got places to go medically or where they can get help from an agency.

YouTube users have been skeptical about Paler Lin's motivation, suggesting it is a 'set-up' so he can gain traffic and profit.

One YouTube user, with the handle ClemtheRanter, said: 'A large number of YouTube prank videos are staged,' he said. 'I was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by Josh Paler Lin. My part of the video was staged... me getting scared by Josh.

Before his haircut he said he was upset at how grey he had become and how long his hair had grown

A store attendant stands alongside Thomas in the mirror as he admires one of the number of suits he tried on during a visit to a mall

Wit his new look and wardrobe, Thomas was treated to a buffet meal at the end of the day by Paler Lin

Gesture... with an agenda? Skeptics have picked holes in a viral video showing a homeless man spending a $100 donation on food for his beggar friends, deeming it a 'fake' creation that was focused on making money

Twist: The short film sees 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin give $100 to a beggar named Thomas in Los Angeles, California - only for him to walk into a Liquor Mart (left) and buy food for his struggling friends (right)

Skepticism: Now, viewers have questioned the video's authenticity, citing a number of 'flaws' in the footage. Above, Lin is pictured in a Facebook photo. He is well-known for producing 'prank' videos for YouTube

Profitable: Some have highlighted the hefty profit Paler Lin has reportedly made from the film's success - up to an enormous $52,000 (above, in red), according to socialblade.com , which tracks YouTube channel statistics

'I asked him if he could give me a shout-out and put my name in the description below so I can get some traffic to my YouTube channel, but it never happened.

'So now i'm addressing this issue due to a number of YouTube pranksters getting exposed for making stage pranks.'

Other users have claimed that homeless feel-good films are a sure-fire way of boosting traffic - and consequently, money, via advertisements - on the social networking site.

'They go to a homeless person and make a feel-good video because they know that's going to get views,' said one YouTube user, referring to the site's personalities, such as Paler Lin.

Fine dining: Thomas is pictured tucking into a Christmas meal in another photo posted on Lin's Instagram

In good spirits: Alongside the picture, YouTube personality Lin wrote: 'I think Thomas had a good X'mas meal'

Using chopsticks: Lin captioned this photo of Thomas: 'Taking Thomas to eat Shabu Shabu in this Xmas eve'

A strange choice: One YouTube user questioned Thomas's choice of a Liquor Mart a 34-minute walk away (pictured) for his food shop - as opposed to a nearer supermarket - saying: 'It seems like an odd coincidence'

Indeed, in November 2013, Paler Lin gave another homeless man $100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food. Again, the real beggar handed over some cash.

The user, with the handle '24/7 rants', claimed the start of Paler Lin's recent homeless video - which sees the director hand Thomas $100, before secretly following him with a camera - immediately suggests it may be a hoax.

Why did Thomas buy food from a liquor store, not a cheaper grocery store?

Why did he stop at a shop a 34-minute walk from the park instead of the shop closest to the park?

If Josh Paler Lin’s business is to make viral-hit videos, why did he set out to ‘expose’ a homeless person spending $100 on booze?

Speaking in his own video, he said Paler Lin could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately, instead of remaining by the roadside.

'How did he know he was going to spend the money immediately? He had no idea,' he said.

He also picked holes in the claim that Thomas did not notice the camera - nor Paler Lin (who has a distinctive haircut) - following him throughout the duration of his trip to a nearby Liquor Mart.

After shopping at the Mart, Thomas was filmed emerging with bags filled with food, before going straight to a park, where he handed out the goods to a number of homeless people.

However, the user questioned the beggar's choice of a Liquor Mart a 34-minute walk away for his food shop - instead of a nearer, cheaper supermarket - saying: 'It seems like an odd coincidence'.

Criticism: One Twitter user, with the handle Cornelius, said the video would shortly be 'exposed as fake'

Joking: One British user joked that he was heading off 'to create a fake homeless friend' and then appeal to locals for donations - following in the wake of Lin's successful fundraising on Indiegogo for Thomas

Casting doubt: Another YouTube user (pictured), with the handle, ClemtheRanter , said Lin is a well-known prankster whom previously worked on a Halloween-themed video with him that was 'set up' to gain traffic

History of fakes? 'A large number of YouTube prank videos are staged,' he said. 'I was involved in a Halloween-themed bloody eyeball scare prank by Josh Paler Lin'. Above, footage of the apparently 'fake' eyeball prank

'Why would this guy, of all places, go to a liquor store to buy chips and pie or whatever when you think that there are tons of other places to go to... that are convenient, probably cheaper.

'That would go with the staging thing because it's like, ""oh look at that, it's a happy twist ending"", and that would make people share it.'

However, Paler Lin argued that Thomas chose the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot, saying: 'When people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you down.'

When questioned by DailyMail.com, he did not explain why Thomas chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park, instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the park.

But he strongly denied staging any of his films or having met Thomas before the $100 exchange.

You're welcome: In Lin's homeless video, Thomas apparently begrudgingly accepts the $100 cash from him

Next: The beggar then walks into a Liquor Mart, where he purchases food for his beggar friends, not alcohol

Giving: The camera following Thomas as he hands food to a family in the park he was initially filmed in

‘I had little expectation, maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he wouldn’t,' he said of the video. 'I wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it on. No one has ever done that before.'

However, the YouTube user claimed the number of hits received by Paler Lin's previous YouTube videos - between 600,000 to 800,000, according to socialblade.com, a site that tracks YouTube channel statistics - could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral hit.

Indeed, Paler Lin - who earns money based on how many users view his videos, most of which are 'pranks' - not only scooped $52,000 from the film, but also gained 13,000 new subscribers.

'[Lin] knows what makes people share videos. He knows all the tactics, probably,' added the user.

Other social media users have pointed out that the video apparently cuts several times as Paler Lin speaks to him by the side of a busy road, meaning he would be able to edit out bad acting.

Candid camera: Lin eventually approaches Thomas to reveal he has been followed. Thomas appears shocked

Grateful: Lin says he was shocked at how the experiment turned out - and has defended its authenticity

And some have said that Thomas's reaction to the camera - 'oh yeah' - was not very realistic.

After the video went viral, Paler Lin said on YouTube: 'I wasn’t expecting to get this kind of footage. To be honest, I thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first.'

He added: 'I’m so glad that I could witness and capture such a beautiful moment. This has to be one of the most amazing experience so far on this channel.

'I did not only just help a homeless man, but I actually met an incredible human being and a friend. We were following him for a couple miles for almost an hour or so.'

In the footage, Thomas told Paler Lin he had quit his job to look after his parents, but after both of them died, he couldn't afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street.

Another video: In November 2013, Lin (pictured, left) gave another homeless man (right) $100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food. The video gained far fewer views than Thomas's

A kind gesture: Again, the beggar handed over some cash (left), prompting the actor to hug him (right)

So taken aback by what happen, Paler Lin said he later took the man the man out for dinner and put him up in a hotel for the night. He also gave him an extra $100 cash.

'The more I talk to him, the more I sense how genuine he is…. I gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help. Never judge a book by its cover. One love!' he said.

Since uploading the video, Paler Lin has posted a number of photos of Thomas to Instagram, including the beggar dressed in a suit and eating a couple of Christmas meals.

He captioned one of the images: 'I think Thomas had a good X'mas meal!'"
1401,"Rumors of the death of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who has not been spotted in months, went into overdrive on Friday night due in part to an unrelated death thousands of miles away.

As the #RIPFidel hashtag began to spread online, it became clear that rumors of Castro's death were being fueled by the high-profile death of a different man with the same name, half a world away.

Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of prominent Kenyan politician and former prime minister Raila Odinga, reportedly died on Jan. 4. His Cuban namesake, however, still appears to be very much alive.

It is with profound sorrow that my wife Ida and I announce the untimely passing of our eldest son, Fidel Castro Odinga.

— Raila Odinga (@RailaOdinga) January 4, 2015

Thousands of mourners took to social media with the hashtag #RIPFidel, as they paid their final respects to the Kenyan Fidel ahead of his funeral Saturday, likely fueling rumors about Cuban Fidel's death.

Fidel Castro Odinga is a high-profile person in Kenya because of his father's political status, so many used social media in the wake of his death to express their condolences, including current Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta.

My condolences go out to the former PM @RailaOdinga and his family. This is a big loss not only to you & your family but the entire country

— Uhuru Kenyatta (@UKenyatta) January 4, 2015

Reports of Fidel Castro's death have been a staple of the international rumor mill for years, with speculation on the former Cuban leader's status bubbling up every few months.

There is no indication that the 88-year-old Castro is on his deathbed. However, he last appeared in public on Jan. 8, 2014 at an art exhibition in Havana, ending nine months out of public view.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21, 2014. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July. Castro was last heard from on Oct. 18, when he published an editorial about Ebola.

In 2006, a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president, and hand over leadership to his younger brother Raul Castro.

Some of the speculation was prompted by Castro's failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on Dec. 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago.

On Friday, Cuba-related Twitter accounts were ablaze with speculation, fueled in large part by reports on news websites, such as Diario de Cuba and Diario las America, that Cuba had scheduled a news conference, possibly to discuss Castro's health.

One CNN journalist added fuel to the fire, tweeting that a speech from Raul was imminent, although he later retracted the information, citing ""bad info from Reuters.""

1420,"The Apple Watch is the most buzzed about wearable to hit the market in a long time, and not all of the buzz is good. We've shared some of th earlier rumblings about the Apple Watch's short battery life. Now we are hearing news of a new feature called Power Reserve, which could be a battery-saving mode that lets the Apple Watch run on low energy while only displaying the time.

The Apple Watch's battery life is expected to only last a day. This puts it at the bottom of the pack for iOS smartwatches. Even with a Power Reserve function, the battery is significantly lagging behind the Pebble Time's seven day battery life. Even before wearables came on the scene, not everyone is diligent about plugging in their smartphones overnight. One of the most frustrating things in the world is a dead battery when you need to check your email, text, or actually make a call.

If the expected battery life is only one day, then we must consider what happens with higher than average usage. Imagine if dynamic and draining apps are engaged, then the battery has the possibility of lasting only until midday. This means that the user will have to take his watch off to charge it.The allure of a wearable is its instant notifications while your phone is tucked away in your pocket. If the Apple Watch isn't on your wrist, will you be drawn to look at the notifications?

Can the new consumers get used to plugging in every night? The Power Reserve feature sounds like it may revert the smartwatch back to an ordinary time piece to save battery life. It's still better than a running out of juice. Without a charge, a dead Apple Watch isn't even a watch. It's just an expensive bracelet. Perhaps the short battery life will be overshadowed by the army of apps and developers Apple has at its disposal. We'll let you know all the emerging details leading up to Apple's big event on March 9th, 2015.

1434,"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. The saying came true for a Macedonian man who chopped off his penis and threw it in the dustbin after he was dumped by his girlfriend for the lack of bedroom skills.

According to a report by The Mirror, the man told medics he felt his small-sized penis was to blame for the split.

Oliver Ilic, 22, said his small penis was useless so he decided to cut it off.

He called doctors after he could not stop the bleeding.

The jilted lover was taken, on a stretcher in bloodstained jeans, to a hospital in the eastern town of Kocani.

The site's sources, which are often reliable, suggest that the event might take place during the last week of February, potentially on Tuesday, February 24.

The event may see Apple once again showcasing the Apple Watch, which is set to debut in April, and it may also see the launch of the 12-inch MacBook Air. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently predicted that the upcoming notebook will debut in March, which is in line with a late-February unveiling.

Rendering of the 12-inch MacBook Air by Martin Hajek
Apple's 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to feature a new ultrathin design that does away with fans and introduces a revamped trackpad. It may include a low-power Core-M processor and it may be the first device to take advantage of the new reversible USB Type-C connector, which is much smaller and allows a USB cable to be inserted into a notebook in any orientation.

Apple may also use the event to unveil additional details on the Apple Watch, such as pricing and battery life. An event showing off the Apple Watch could explain why Apple has been asking some developers to have their apps ready to launch in the App Store in mid-February, as we reported last week. It's possible that Apple will use apps from these developers to demonstrate additional capabilities of the watch.

Though rumored, a February event is by no means confirmed at this point, and it is unclear what else Apple might cover in addition to the Apple Watch and the 12-inch MacBook Air.

Update 12:23 PM: Sources speaking to 9to5Mac have indicated Apple will not be holding a late February media event.

Flight 567, which originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, was taxiing for takeoff on Saturday at Los Angeles International Airport when the woman was stung, airline spokesman Cole Cosgrove said. The plane returned to the gate, where medics treated the woman and offered additional medical treatment, which she declined, Cosgrove said. She did not get back on the plane, he said. Passengers stayed on board, he said. The woman brushed the scorpion away after the sting and killed it on the floor with her foot, Cosgrove said. The crew of the Boeing 737 checked for other scorpions and the plane departed about 50 minutes late, he said. ""We don't know exactly how the scorpion made it on the plane, but the flight did originate in Los Cabos, Mexico, where scorpions are known to live,"" Cosgrove said. The airline was reaching out to the woman on Sunday regarding possible compensation for her inconvenience and to check on her condition, Cosgrove said. Only about 30 of about 1,500 species of scorpions can cause potentially fatal stings, according the website of the Mayo Clinic.

1477,"We've heard rumors for some time that Apple's been less than pleased with the purported battery life of its upcoming Apple Watch. And now, it looks as though it has plenty of reason to be worried. According to a new report from 9 to 5 Mac, the Apple Watch the battery is looking at just 2.5 to 4 hours of ""active application use"" before it dies. Yeesh.

According to 9 to 5 Mac's report, while Apple (along with everyone else who's had their eyes on one) was hoping its Watch would last for at least a full day on a single charge, it's had to significantly change its tune thanks to the power-sucking Retina screen and A5 processor:

As of 2014, Apple wanted the Watch to provide roughly 2.5 to 4 hours of active application use versus 19 hours of combined active/passive use, 3 days of pure standby time, or 4 days if left in a sleeping mode. Sources, however, say that Apple will only likely achieve approximately 2-3 days in either the standby or low-power modes…

But if you're hoping to use the Apple Watch for fitness tracking, there is (sort of?) better news: ""Apple expects to see better battery life when using the Watch's fitness tracking software, which is targeted for nearly 4 hours of straight exercise tracking on a single charge. "" Which, sure, is better than the two-and-a-half hours you'd get under normal heavy use, but there's no way this is going to be tracking more than the lone workout.

As a point of comparison, the Moto 360 easily lasts a full day of mixed-use. Our own Eric Limer's watch still had a little under half of its battery left after about 16-hours of wear. Even the Samsung Gear S, which is essentially a full-fledged phone for your wrist, can go a full day easy. And of course, the Pebble Smartwach, which is admittedly a very different beast, can last close to a full week on a single charge.

Still, while these numbers certainly seem awful, most people probably aren't going to be browsing Facebook and playing games on their wrist four hours. Apple expects most people to be wearing the Watch passively for the majority of the day, but while they were originally shooting for about 19 hours of ""mixed usage,"" 9 to 5 Mac's sources say that Apple no longer thinks it can even hit that—at least not in this first generation.

1488,"The man who breached security at the White House this month overpowered a U.S. Secret Service officer and ran through much of the main floor, penetrating farther into the building than previously disclosed, the Washington Post reported on Monday, citing three people familiar with the incident.

“The Secret Service has no comment on that at this time due to the ongoing investigation,” Brian Leary, a spokesman for the agency, said of the Post story. A White House spokesman declined comment.

The suspect, Omar Gonzalez, 42, was charged with unlawfully entering a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon. Officials said he was carrying a knife when he jumped the White House fence and entered the executive mansion on Sept. 19.

A prosecutor said in court last week that officers found more than 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets and a machete in Gonzalez' car.

Gonzalez, a decorated Iraq war veteran, had been arrested in July with a sniper rifle and a map on which the executive mansion was marked, the prosecutor said.

The Post said Gonzalez ran past a guard immediately inside the door, past the stairway leading up to the Obama family's living quarters and into the East Room, where he was tackled at the far end of the room by an agent.

The alarm box near the entrance, designed to alert guards to an intruder, had been muted at what officers believe was the request of the usher's office, the Post said, citing the Secret Service official.

The officer posted inside the door appeared to be delayed in learning the intruder was about to come through, the Post said. Officers are trained to lock the front door immediately if they learn of an intruder on the grounds.

“Branson tried to pull out all of the stops,” claimed the Mirror’s source, who claimed it was enough to convince Page, Jones, and Bonham to reprise their 2007 Celebration Day show, and that the band was even considering a further 45-night tour across five more venues. “But even [Branson’s] money was not enough to get Plant to sign up,” the source said. “[He] asked for 48 hours to think about it,” then ripped up the contract in front of a group of promoters. “His mind is made up and that’s that.”

Rumours were rife earlier this year that Zeppelin would be reforming, and Page seemed newly furious at his former bandmate. “Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band,” Page said. “[Robert]’s just playing games, and I’m fed up with it, to be honest with you.”

At the end of September, Page said a reunion was no longer “a possibility or on the cards”. He told journalists at an event to promote the reissues of Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy: “I’m not going to give a detail-by-detail account of what one person says or another person says, so there’s not much more I can say about that.” The guitarist explained that he is instead planning to revisit Led Zeppelin material on a 2015 solo tour.

1498,"A prominent religious scholar in Saudi Arabia has reportedly issued a fatwa against building snowmen in the kingdom, stating the practice is not acceptable to Islam.

Mohammad Saleh Al Minjed said people must not build any snowmen or snow models of animals, according to Gulf News.

However, making snow models of lifeless things, such as ships, fruit and buildings, was apparently acceptable in Islam, the scholar said.

""It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun,"" he reportedly said.

""God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,"" he added.

No date was set for the implementation of the fatwa and there was no government comment. Any cleric in Saudi Arabia is entitled to issue a fatwa, but they have basis under Saudi law.

There was immediate reaction on social media to the story.

""It has no value in our traditions, and those who are fascinated by the West should emulate their inventions and sciences, not their culture,"" one unnamed blogger said.

Another stated: ""We have snow for fleeting days, maybe even hours, and there is always someone who wants to rob us of the joy and the fun. It seems that the only thing left for us is to sit down and drink coffee.""

While Saudia Arabia is the second hottest country in the world, the kingdom has been hit by snowstorms this month, notably in the Tabuk region around 1000 kilometres northwest of the capital, Riyadh."
1513,"A few years ago it may have seemed rather impossible for the relationship between Apple and Samsung to improve, but 2014 was and continues to be a year full of surprises. After Apple and Samsung withdrew all patent infringement lawsuits (except for those in the US) earlier this summer, the collaboration between the two tech giants seemed to have grown healthier.

Now, industry sources suggest that this partnership will tighten even further, as Samsung is expected to supply more components for the Cupertino-based giant, for both the iPhone 6 as well as the Apple Watch.

iPhone 6 and Even Apple Watch To Feature Samsung Components (Rumor)
iPhone 6 and Even Apple Watch To Feature Samsung Components (Rumor)
iPhone 6 and Apple Watch to feature Samsung-made Components

A fresh report from Korea suggests that iPhone 6 units which will be manufactured in the future will make use of batteries manufactured by Samsung SDI. In addition, sources also consider the possibility that Apple will reach out to Samsung in order to employ the Korean tech giant’s NAND flash.

Apparently, Apple’s initial plans were to use Samsung’s NAND flash for the iPhone 6, but because the two companies have failed to agree on the prices, Apple has decided to use Toshiba’s TLC NAND flash in the 128 GB iPhone 6, and various other components manufactured by SK Hynix, Toshiba and SanDisk on the 64 GB variant. However, since the TLC NAND flash on the 64 and 128 GB iPhone 6 and 6 Plus proved to cause headaches, sources say that Apple might strike a deal with Samsung in order to supply both the NAND flash and the DRAM of future-to-be-manufactured iPhone 6 units. In addition, some industry insiders speculate that both companies are currently jointly developing communications chips for the next-gen iPhone.



 
As for the Apple Watch, the same report suggests that Apple already discussed with Samsung in regards to the supply of application processors for the wearable device, which is set to hit the market in early 2015.

It looks like the emerging Chinese smartphone manufacturers have become powerful enough to persuade both Apple and Samsung to put some of their differences aside for the(ir) greater good. These are odd times we live in, no doubt."
1514,"What began as an Occupy-inspired student sit-in exploded in Hong Kong over the weekend as police responded with excessive force toward peaceful demonstrators, using tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets. The Occupy Central protests spread from Hong Kong’s financial district to just outside the city’s government offices in Admiralty, but the law-enforcement crackdown had the opposite effect, sending thousands more into the streets in solidarity and shutting down portions of the city. The protests have now bled into the work week and riot police have pulled back, at least for now. Here’s what you need to know so far.

What started this?

After 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997, but has operated semi-autonomously under what’s known as “one country, two systems,” outside of Beijing’s communist rule. The promise was that in 2017, Hong Kong would be allowed, for the first time, to elect its own leader (known as chief executive) in democratic elections, instead of having the slot filled by a committee from Beijing. But earlier this summer, China decided a committee was still necessary, and it would select the candidates for Hong Kong’s 2017 elections. Outrage has been building ever since.

Who’s out there?

The protests were organized in part by the Hong Kong Federation of Students, which has since called for an indefinite student strike, the New York Times reports. Young people are everywhere, but not alone. The Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union has joined them with a general strike, as have some professionals after the weekend violence — “office workers in slacks and dress shirts mixed with crowds of students in black T-shirts,” according to the Times.

Occupy Central with Love and Peace, meanwhile, is led by a University of Hong Kong law professor named Benny Tai, Businessweek reported earlier this summer. Tai has been organizing for months, and a look at his planning from June now serves as some serious foreshadowing:

At some point, Tai says the movement may follow through on the threat in its name and occupy Central, where most of Hong Kong’s top banks and other financial institutions (as well as Bloomberg) have their offices. Many companies are already taking no chances, developing plans in case demonstrators block the streets and prevent employees from getting to work.

What do they want?

In addition to democratic elections in 2017 and continued autonomy for Hong Kong, as previously promised, protesters are now demanding the resignation of current chief executive Leung Chun-ying. The economics are also less than ideal, and the country could be slipping into a recession.

How is the government reacting?

Not well, especially at first. Here’s a video from the ground of protesters being teargassed, in attacks that look familiar from Ferguson and helped stoke outrage among citizens:

The use of pepper spray has been equally alarming, and is reminiscent of previous Occupy protests in the U.S.

Hong Kong police officer grabs elderly protester, turns and pepper sprays them full in the face: http://t.co/5l0pFtGGTF

As Vox notes, some protesters have taken to using the “hands up, don’t shoot” imagery of the Michael Brown demonstrations in Ferguson. It’s still a powerful image on the other side of the world:

.@attorneycrump Will you please show this to #MikeBrown's parents &let them know that he changed the WORLD! #HongKong pic.twitter.com/3u4FOSnp7x

Protesters in Ferguson have sent a message back:

Heather, a #Ferguson protester, wearing a sign that says ""Stay strong #HongKong."" pic.twitter.com/9CnqFfERfL

It’s not surprising, then, that Beijing is blaming the West for stoking tensions. From the Times:

A commentary on the website of the People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s main newspaper, claimed that the upheavals in Hong Kong were instigated by democratic radicals who had sought support from “anti-China forces” in Britain and the United States, and had sought lessons from independence activists in Taiwan. It called them a “gang of people whose hearts belong to colonial rule and who are besotted with ‘Western democracy’.”

Hong Kong has canceled its annual fireworks celebration of China’s National Day on Wednesday, indicating that this thing may continue for the foreseeable future.

“The protesters, they are so young,” a mother of two who joined the protests on Monday told the Times. “They are fighting for our future, for my children’s future.”"
1523,"""I just wanted some chicken wings.""

After getting dumped by her boyfriend, a woman in China realized that only one person could help her in her time of need: Colonel Sanders.

Tan Shen, 26, accidentally on-purpose spent a full week at a 24/7 KFC in Chengdu, calling in sick to work, to mourn the loss of her relationship.

“I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings,” Tan told Yahoo. “But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.”

But is KFC really where you’d want to spend your time of mourning? Are the chicken wings really that good?

After all, Tan herself admits that after a week, “I was getting sick of the taste of chicken, so there was no point in staying there anymore.” (That and local media started showing up to take photos).

Here are some places that might have been better week-long hideaways:

McDonald’s Find a Play Place and start enjoying the little things in life again.

Walmart If it’s good enough for a 9-month pregnant woman, as depicted in Where The Heart Is, it should be good enough for the lovesick.

Anthropologie Just so aesthetically pleasing.

A make-your-own, pay-by-the-pound Fro-Yo shop Because… cliches.

Maybe then Tan would have looked slightly more upbeat:

1529,"Rumors have hit social media that the Batmobile has been stolen from the Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice set in Detroit. While on the face of it the idea that someone could actually make off with a Batmobile from the heavily-secured set seem somewhat ludicrous, the local Michigan media seems to be taking the reports seriously enough that the police department has been contacted to look into it.

CBS Detroit notes in their report, “Does this person — if the rumor is true (we don’t know how credible the source is) — think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?” WWJ950 tweets, “Was The Batmobile Stolen In #Detroit? Unconfirmed Rumors Are Swirling, And Police Tell WWJ They'll Look Into It.”

Of course, it’s a little unclear from the tweet if the police department is actually looking into the disappearance of the Batmobile or is just looking into the source of the unconfirmed rumors. Most sites seem to be pointing to Bleeding Cool as the source of the rumors, which they report as having heard from sources in Detroit.

By now, you’ve probably heard about #hairgate, which has people chattering about an unintended problem with the iPhone 6. According to a forum post on 9to5Mac, Apple’s latest phone traps hair in the seam between the glass and aluminum. “When you try to free it out, it hurts,” the poster laments.
Related: 10 Must-Try Beauty Apps 
Sounds like a pain, but aside from some tweets, is there any real evidence of the iPhone ripping out hair? That depends on who you ask. As Mashable demonstrates in a video, it just doesn’t seem to be happening. A variety of men and women — some with short hair, others with long hair — tested the new iPhone by taking calls, rubbing the device on their beards, “combing” their curls with it. Not a one experienced pulling or snagging. Meanwhile, enterprising YouTubers are uploading videos that demonstrate exactly the opposite effect. (#Hairgate truthers, perhaps?)
All of it adds up to a lot of outrage, with #hairgate getting thousands of tweets as well as a Today segment. It’s true that when you drop a few hundred on a new gadget, you’d like to think it won’t gobble up your hair. Considering the severity of this alleged injury, though, we can’t help but think of another hashtag: #firstworldproblems."
1539,"TORONTO – A Canadian soldier was shot at the War Memorial in Ottawa Wednesday morning, and multiple shots were fired inside Parliament Hill.

According to a witness, the shooter had black hair, was wearing a grey jacket and a scarf.

Witnesses reported gunfire inside the halls of Parliament, including a dozen shots outside the Parliament Hill library.

Police and ambulance are on the scene, and Parliament Hill is in lockdown.


Ottawa police confirmed they had a call at 9:52 a.m. with a report of shots fired.

Witnesses on the scene at the War Memorial said they were in shock; a number of them performed CPR on the victim.

“I’m just trying to grasp it now,” said a male witness, who said soldiers were doing their “normal drill.”

“They were doing their march with their rifle in their hand and he [the suspect] came out on the right hand side here and fired a shot right at one of the soldiers. [The soldier] went down and the other went to his aid. The suspect took off across the street into a vehicle,” he said.

1544,"The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is investigating an incident of a dog abandoned at a train station along with a suitcase.

The SPCA says the dog was found Jan. 2 tied to a railing at the Ayr railway station in South Ayrshire, Scotland. The suitcase was filled with possessions, including a pillow, a toy, food bowl, and food, according to the SPCA.

Inspector Stewart Taylor said the dog's name is Kai.

Officials said the male shar-pei crossbreed, who is 2 or 3 years old, had a microchip and they were able to track down the last registered owner.

""Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him. This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about,"" according to the SPCA website.

The SPCA says the society will look after him until a suitable owner is found.

In the country, abandoning an animal violates the Animal Health and Welfare Act of 2006. The SPCA says, ""Anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life.""

1554,"A Muslim convert shot dead a Canadian soldier at the National War Memorial in Ottawa today before exchanging dozens of shots with guards inside Parliament in a terrifying attack that left the nation's capital on lockdown.

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, as he stood guard at the War Memorial on Wednesday morning.

Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, then ran inside the Parliament, where he opened fire before he was shot dead by the House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms.

And now, we have our first look at Zehaf-Bibeau in a photo that shows him holding a gun and wearing a keffiyeh.

Scroll down for videos

Gunman: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the Muslim convert who shot dead solider Nathan Cirillo and opened fire on Canadian Parliament

Race: An Ottawa police officer runs with his weapon drawn outside Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday after multiple gunmen attacked the Parliament and a nearby mall, injuring at least three people

Final moments: Cirillo (left) is pictured guarding the National War Memorial just minutes before he was shot

Zehaf-Bibeau was born in Quebec as Michael Joseph Hall.

A criminal court database shows a man with the same name was arrested five times while living in Montreal.

Zehaf-Bibeau was charged in February 2004 for possession of marijuana and possession of PCP. He pleaded guilty to both charges in December 2004, serving one day in prison for marijuana possession and 60 days for PCP possession.

He also spent a day in jail in March of 2004 for a parole violation and was again convicted of marijuana possession in 2009, reports Global News.

In 2011, he was charged with robbery in Vancouver but served only one day in prison after he pleaded guilty to the lesser included offence of uttering threats. and was credited with 66 days in pre-trial custody.

Sources told the Globe and Mail that he had been designated a 'high-risk traveler' and the government had seized his passport

His attack comes just two days after another Canadian soldier was killed in Quebec by a man with jihadist sympathies.

Authorities initially said they believed 'two or three' gunmen were responsible for the attack in Ottawa on Wednesday, but at an afternoon press conference, Chief of Police Charles Bordeleau would not confirm whether or not they are still searching for other shooters.

'We're still in the process of clearing Parliament Hill,' he said. 'It is a slow and methodical process.'

The shooting spree began at 9.52am when witnesses reported seeing a gunman climb out of a car, grab a rifle, shoot the soldier in the abdomen and then run towards Parliament.

Corporal Cirillo was rushed to hospital but later succumbed to his injuries.

Cirillo, a fitness fanatic and animal lover with a young son, was a reservist serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in Hamilton.

'Nathan was a good man,' friend Marie Michele told CBC News. 'He would give anything to anyone.'

Ottawa police then received a call at 9.54am that shots had been heard inside the Parliament, while journalists cowering inside said they heard dozens of rounds and could smell gunpowder in the halls.

A shootout unfolded and Zehaf-Bibeau was killed by Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before joining the Parliament in 2006. (He is pictured by the Hill Times.)

'I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe,' said Julian Fantino, Canada's Minister of Veterans Affairs, on Twitter.

The Sergeant-at-Arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons and providing safety and security of the Parliament buildings and the people inside.

As gunfire erupted in the hallways, journalists and politicians scrambled for safety, while members in the Conservative Party caucus room blocked the door with a stack of chairs.

A parliamentary guard was shot in the leg during the gunfight but is recovering in hospital, according to Globe and Mail reporter Josh Wingrove, who is inside the building.

He had been scheduled to give Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai, co-winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, her Canadian citizenship today.

The government said there is not yet any evidence that Zehaf-Bibeau has any ties to violent Islamic extremism but noted that it is still early in the investigation.

An Ottawa Citizen reporter inside the Parliament building, Jordan Press, wrote on Twitter that a suspect was '5'9-5'10, overweight & wearing a dark jacket'.

Witnesses also told the Citizen that they saw a man wearing an 'Arabic scarf' and carrying a long rifle, while others said the suspect looked South American.

He said that the man jumped over a fence around Parliament Hill and forced someone out of their car, then drove to the front doors of the Parliament building and fired at least twice.

Reporter Jordan Press added that the car - a Toyota Corolla - was parked in front of the building with its engine still running.

A video shot by a Globe and Mail reporter showed RCMP officers moving through Parliament's main hall toward the Parliamentary library, as the hallway echoed with gunfire.

Other reporters inside the building described the panic in the hallways.

He went on: 'I was in the west wing of the building and shooter appears to have entered through main door on south side, heading north along hallway.

'I heard dozens of gunshots and the smell of gunpowder is heavy in the hallways right now.'

He added: 'One security guard said that it appears one officer may have been shot but we have no way to confirm that.'

Speaking to CNN, Wingrove said it appeared Zehaf-Bibeau entered the front entrance that has 'many armed guards' but no metal detector'.

'If you flash your valid pass, they allow you to go in,' he said. 'This appears to be the entry point [of the gunman] based on witness accounts.'

1558,"If there’s one thing Apple currently lacks, it’s a good social layer to their various offerings. Perhaps to satiate our need to be digitally social, Apple is reportedly close to purchasing the nearly four-year-old Path. Insiders say the deal may already be done, too.

According to Pando Daily, one well-placed source on Apple’s Engineering squad says “It’s almost done, if not signed already, but it’s essentially a done deal.” So why is Apple interested in Path, if they indeed are? In a way, they’re kindred.

Path struggles to find users, but that’s obviously not why they and Apple are so similar. If anything positive can be said of Path, it’s with their design. They’ve been widely lauded as a heavy-hitter when it comes to UI and experience, something Apple covets in their own right.
Further evidence of this comes with news that Dave Morin — current Path CEO and former Apple employee — was spotted sitting front and center at Apple’s iPhone 6/Apple Watch event yesterday. That’s a spot typically reserved for top brass and partners, not the CEO if a hit-and-miss social platform Apple has no involvement in.

Apple snapping up Path is also said to be more than an acquihire to get folks like Morin back in the fold. Pando’s source says Path will survive the acquisition whole, and be cobbled (somehow, maybe lightly) into Apple’s revamped Messaging app.

It seems a likely acquisition, and it will be interesting to see how Apple works Path into their fold. Path is good, but suffers the same “ghost town” moniker that haunts other social platforms like Google+. But hey, at least it will probably work out better than Apple’s previous social experiment, right?

Right?

1589,"President Obama declared that the entire world was “appalled” by the beheading of an American journalist by militants in Syria, but vowed that America would not change course in Iraq, where the United States has been conducting airstrikes against terrorists, despite threats by the group to kill another reporter in the days ahead.

“The United States of America will continue to do what we must do to protect our people,” Mr. Obama said in a brief statement from Martha’s Vineyard, where he was vacationing. “We will be vigilant and we will be relentless.”

Before speaking to reporters, Mr. Obama said he placed a phone call to the parents of James Foley, the slain reporter, telling them that Americans were “are all heartbroken at their loss.” He described Mr. Foley as a “journalist, a son, a brother and a friend who was “taken from us in an act of violence that shocked the conscience of the entire world.”

But the president’s harshest and most emotional words were reserved for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the militants who released a video of the killing of Mr. Foley on Tuesday. American intelligence agencies on Wednesday verified the authenticity of the video, which shows a masked man decapitating James Foley, an American journalist who was kidnapped in Syria nearly two years ago. It also shows another American captive, the journalist Steven Sotloff, and warns that he would be the next to die.

The president called ISIS a “cancer” in the region and accused them of having “rampaged across cities and villages, killing unarmed civilians in cowardly acts of violence.” He said it had committed torture and rape against innocent women and children and continued to enslave those they did not kill.

“No faith teaches people to massacre innocents,” Mr. Obama said. “No just God would stand for what they did yesterday and what they do every single day. People like this ultimately fail. They fail because the future is won by people who build and not destroy.”

The killing of Mr. Foley triggered a fierce response. The New York Daily News and The New York Post both used the same banner headline on their front pages: “Savages.” Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain released a statement saying “the brutal murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved.”

At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement condemning ISIS for “the horrific murder of journalist James Foley, an abominable crime.” Mr. Ban said “the perpetrators of this and other such horrific crimes must be brought to justice.”

The four-minute, 40-second video was posted on YouTube but the website later took it down. Titled “A Message to America,” it shows Mr. Foley kneeling in a desert landscape, clad in an orange jumpsuit in an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Standing to his left is a masked ISIS fighter who begins speaking in English, with what sounds like an East London accent. Pulling out a knife, he says that Mr. Foley’s execution is in retaliation for the recent American airstrikes ordered by Mr. Obama against the extremist group in Iraq."
1591,"The Beats Music brand could be singing its last tune.

According to a report published by TechCrunch, Apple has begun to wind down the streaming music service that it acquired in May, with many of its staffers already moved onto other projects at Apple. ITunes is said to be one of them.

Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers already has been put in charge of iTunes Radio, with the Beats Music technology likely to be integrated into that service, sources say.

Beats Music has not been heavily promoted during Apple’s recent product demonstrations, including the launch of its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as well as its Apple Watch.

In fact, the new smartphones do not include Beats Music pre-loaded as an app — an unusual move and sign that Apple has other plans for Beats Music’ technology. U2’s free album was offered through Beats Music.

While the Apple Watch, out next year, will include a music app, Beats Music wasn’t mentioned during its launch demo.

The confusion two separate music services could generate among consumers is said to be one of the reasons Apple is making the move to close Beats Music. Apple also had shut down another streaming service, Lala, after acquiring it.

While Apple isn’t expected to entirely do away with Beats Music, the company is rethinking whether to still operate it as a separate brand, sources also confirmed to Re/Code.

While Beats Music has the Beats headphone brand helping put it in the spotlight, the service has struggled to compete against more established online players like Spotify, Pandora, Rdio and Google Music.

It had just 111,000 paying subscribers in March, and 250,000 in May, according to Jimmy Iovine. That’s compared to 10 million for Spotify.

Beats Music was part of the $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics Apple made in August.

Apple and Beats have not commented on the potential shuttering of the service.

Apple is having to take a close look at its iTunes business as digital music sales fell 13.3% in 2013, whereas streaming grew 32% last year in the U.S."
1596,"Reports Monday said that Islamist fighters for ISIS, the Islamic State, which has already conquered large areas of Lebanon and Iraq, are at the gates of Baghdad. Despite the aerial attacks being carried out by the US and its allies, the group's fighters have been steadily progressing, and are said to be barely a mile from the city. The report in the Independent newspaper, published in London, quoted officials of the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East.

According to the officials, Islamic State terrorists could basically enter the city at will, as there is little substantial defense to prevent them from doing so. ""The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad,"" the spokesperson said. “They said it could never happen and now it almost has. [US President Barack] Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do,"" the report quoted the spokesperson as saying.

Obama indeed made that admission Sunday night, in an interview broadcast on CBS news program 60 Minutes. “Over the past couple of years, during the chaos of the Syrian civil war, where essentially you have huge swathes of the country that are completely ungoverned,"" the president said, Islamic State was ""able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos.

""This became ground zero for jihadists around the world,"" Obama said of Syria, where Islamic State now controls territory in the east around on the city of Raqqa. “Where you've got states that are failing or in the midst of civil war, these kinds of organizations thrive,"" he said.

In a separate development over the weekend, the head of the Syrian Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra Front said that it would work with Islamic State to defeat the “Western infidels,” reports said. ""Muslims will not watch while their sons are bombed. Your leaders will not be the only ones who would pay the price of the war. You will pay the heaviest price,"" he said, warning that the battle would be brought ""to the hearts of your homes,” said Al-Nusra head Abu Mohamad al-Golani. ""You should protect yourselves from this war by standing against the decisions of your rulers and stop them from bringing you the woes (of war),"" he added, according to Reuters.

""We are in a long war. This war will not end in months nor years. This war could last for decades,"" group spokesman Abu Firas al-Suri said.

""It's not a war against Nusra Front, it's a war against Islam,” he added.

IS and the Al-Nusra Front share the same ideology and rigid Islamic beliefs, but they fell out during a power struggle and have been battling each other this past year.

Nusra Front is now coming under pressure from its own members to reconcile with Islamic State and join forces to fight what they describe as a ""crusader"" campaign against Islam.

Al-Nusra Front, whose leader pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri, has been heavily involved in the fighting in Syria as well as in neighboring Lebanon, where it has claimed responsibility for several bombings and has also threatened local Sunnis.

Most recently, members of the group kidnapped 45 Fijian UN peacekeepers and threatened to try them under Islamic law before ultimately releasing them."

The planes, which are believed to be MiG-21 and MiG-23 jets, are capable of flying although it is unclear if they are equipped with missiles, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.


The jets were seized from Syrian military airports now under IS control in the northern provinces of Aleppo and Raqqa, according to the Britain-based group, which has a wide network of sources inside the war-torn country.

It said that former Iraqi army officers who once served under Saddam were supervising the training at the military airport of Jarrah, east of the city of Aleppo.

Witnesses have reported seeing planes flying at a low altitude to avoid detection by radar after taking off from Jarrah.

It comes as the United States and its allies carry out a wave of air strikes on IS positions in Syria and Iraq.

The jihadists also control two other airports in Syria — Albu Kamal near the Iraqi border and Tabqa in Raqa province.

IS has captured large parts of Syria and Iraq, committing atrocities and declaring an Islamic “caliphate”.

After the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, some Sunni former officers from Saddam’s army joined the ranks of the Islamic State of Iraq, a branch of Al-Qaeda which later became IS."

Snopes.com came up with a number of intriguing arguments that could indicate Jasmine Tridevil did not actually pay $20,000 (£12,190) for an extra breast.

It argued the fact she didn’t have anyone else take the photos was suspicious, and also added the person who registered JasmineTridevil.com was called Alisha Hessler, who was no stranger to the internet.

A business page attributed Hessler, states she is the ‘provider of internet hoaxes since 2014’, which could possibly be the most damning evidence of all.

It also emerged Hessler, who has not been confirmed as being Tridevil, was arrested for fraudulent use of personal information in 2013.

In the same year she claimed she forced a man who assaulted her to hold an embarrassing sign on a motorway saying ‘I beat women. Honk if I’m a scumbag.’

She had reportedly threatened to tell police of his crime if he didn’t.

Officers confirmed she had withdrawn a complaint against him when pressed for more details, according to Snopes.

A top plastic surgeon, Mr Nilesh Sojitra, also cast doubt over the surgery after claiming no ‘reasonable’ doctor would perform the operation

‘Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would,’ he told Buzzfeed.

Igor Vorozhbitsyn told the Austrian Times he was fishing in northern Russia's Yakutia Republic when a bear attacked him. The man thought he was done for, but when the bear clawed at him, his cellphone went off. The ringtone, Justin Bieber's ""Baby,"" caused the bear to run away.

Wildlife experts believe the ringtone - according to local media the singer's hit 'Baby' - must have startled the bear into halting its attack.

""Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,"" explained one.

Igor suffered from cuts and severe bruises to his face and chest and was rescued when he was found by other fishermen after using the phone to call for help.
The bear's actions are completely understandable. Who among us hasn't ran, screeching in a state of panic from the room when Bieber's ""Baby"" is played? I often use ""Baby"" to scare away annoying door-to-door salesman or pesky types like my landlord with her annoying questions about why I haven't paid my rent or what the smell coming from my apartment is. I hear the Pentagon is currently experimenting with using the song in place of a missile defensive system for the United States. Bieber could save this country billions in national defense.

1627,"THIS is the terrible moment a desperately poor young woman tries to sell her son – to fund life-saving treatment for her daughter.

Mum Meng Xiangyan faced a real-life Sophie's Choice when poverty forced her to decide between her twins.

The distraught 29-year-old said that she and her husband loved both of their children.

But with certain death awaiting their daughter unless they could get medical treatment, they were prepared to sell their son to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures published in local media show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, which is a major city in eastern Shandong Province, Eastern China, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

He was eating what appeared to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appealed for someone to come forward and buy the boy.

She said: ""Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

""But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives. It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.""

Medics say that the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold up their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10 square metre flat close to where the therapies are being carried out. The parents are also struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

So far, there have been no offers on their son, who has not been named.

Their desperation follows on from a similar recent story in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband, Zhou Xinggui, are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: ""Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.""

In the four hours she sat with the sign, no-one bought her daughter."

1656,"A video has emerged with claims that it shows a large, hairy figure walking swiftly through a snowy, wooded area in Russia. Key details about the incident are missing. But the visuals are remarkable.

Watch it here:

According to Mirror online, some Russian adventurers went in search of the elusive Yeti -- that's what many call Bigfoot in Russia -- after reports of creature sightings emerged from a remote region of the southwestern Adygea Republic in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. The map below shows Adygea's capital city of Maykop.

The research team spoke to local residents who said they saw the unusual animal.

The Daily Mail reports that one eyewitness, Ludmila Hristoforova, told a local television station, ""The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we've seen something big and shaggy.""

Another resident, Andrei Kazaryan (who Mysterious Universe suggests was one of the investigators), said, ""I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house. Although we didn't see anyone, we saw its huge footprints.""

The researchers claimed they captured that video footage -- seen above -- of the hairy Yeti. They also made a plaster cast of a large footprint found in the snow.

Both the video footage and the footprint cast are now reportedly in the hands of local scientists. Oddly, the names have not been revealed of those scientists or of the original researchers who say they took the video.

This story brings up other dubious questions:

Why no exact date or time of the alleged video encounter?

Why is it that, after the ""Yeti"" moves quickly through the snow from right to left, seeming to elude the research group as fast as it can, it suddenly stops its forward motion and casually turns to the right, not appearing to be in a hurry, almost as if it/he was waiting for further cinematic direction from those who were doing the videotaping?

This story is hot on the heels of two other Bigfoot tales we've reported on so far in January, including one that set off a huge controversy about a reported Skunk Ape photographed in Tampa, Florida.

There was also the one about how the Arizona Department of Transportation posted an image on its Facebook page, purporting to show ""a family of Sasquatches"" standing in snow next to a highway on Jan. 1. That turned out to be a little joke played on the public by Arizona state transportation officials.

We have a feeling 2015 hasn't seen the last of Bigfoot.

1679,"A video allegedly showing the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley, who has been missing in Syria for 636 days, by the terror organisation the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), was released today. In their video, which has not been verified yet, the group claims that the beheading is “a message to the US to end its intervention in Iraq.”

According to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)the freelance journalist was abducted by an “organised gang” in northern Syria on November 22, 2012.

On November 22, 2012, James Wright Foley, a freelance photo journalist, was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria. Foley had employed a translator to help him travel across the Syrian-Turkish border. The translator was also taken, but later released.
Condolences are pouring on the Free James Foely page, set up by family, which was set up after his kidnapping and which had appealed for his release unharmed.

Zaid Benjamin, a Washington DC-based journalist, tells his 43.3K followers on Twitter, posting still photographs taken from the video:

Benjamin's Twitter account has since been reportedly suspended for about half an hour – for sharing footage from the video at the centre of this story. The account has now been restored.

The video, which has also been removed from YouTube, has sparked a discussion online on whether such material should be permissible on the world wide web on the grounds that it allows the ISIS to share its “propaganda.” Brown Moses provides a transcript of the video here.

Ruwayda Mustafah, a UK-based Kurdish blogger with around 40K followers on Twitter, notes:

Like many, Mustafah calls for an ISIS blackout on social media:

Online, the ISIS has been active showing off its horrific exploits in Syria and Iraq for the world to see. The ISIS came to prominence last year after Jihadists from around the world joined its fighters in Syria, first to fight against the Assad regime, and later to fight other armed factions in the war-torn country. In June, the Al-Qaeda splinter group, which controls parts of Syria, annexed Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, as the world watched in horror.

1681,"(CNN) -- Boko Haram laughed off Nigeria's announcement of a ceasefire agreement, saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in spring have been converted to Islam and married off.

Nigerian officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the Islamist terror group.

The deal, the government said, included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping in April at a boarding school in the nation's north stunned the world.

In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials.

""Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?"" Abubakar Shekau said. ""They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.""

Shekau slammed reports of their planned release.

""We married them off. They are in their marital homes,"" he said, chuckling.

The group's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal, saying he does not represent Boko Haram.

""We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,"" he said of the negotiator.

It wasn't clear when the video was made.

Mike Omeri, coordinator of Nigeria's National Information Centre, told CNN on Saturday that all these claims contradict those made in conversations in which the Nigerian government has been involved.

Omeri said Nigeria's government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to the aide.

The ceasefire deal announced October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.

After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad.

That day passed without any signs of the girls.

Boko Haram a growing challenge

In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more ""war, striking and killing with gun.""

This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead.

Days later, members of the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria, residents said Thursday.

Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said.

For its part, the Nigerian government isn't backing down.

Rather, it is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said on Saturday.

The military claimed its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two of the states in northeastern Nigeria that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram.

Officials are ""studying"" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said.

Boko Haram, whose name translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state.

The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government.

As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

CNN's Isha Sesay, Lillian Leposo, Christabelle Fombu, Greg Botelho and Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report."
1690,"A Canadian-Israeli woman who has joined the ranks of the Kurdish militias fighting Islamic State in northern Syria has been taken captive by ISIS fighters, blogs and Islamist websites thought to be close to the militant group reported.

A blog considered to be one of the Islamic State's media arms reported that several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been captured, among them Gill Rosenberg. According to the report, prior to their capture Islamic State fighters made three suicide bombing attacks against Kurdish outposts, killing some and capturing many others.

According to Israel Radio, Kurdish sources denied the reports, saying Rosenberg wasn't in the area when it was attacked.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, a resident of Tel Aviv, joined the Kurdish troops against Islamic State in northern Syria earlier this month. According to reports, Rosenberg said she had contacted Kurdish fighters over the Internet before traveling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

According to Walla, Rosenberg immigrated to Israel from Canada in 2006, leaving behind a career as a civilian pilot, and served for two years in the Israel Defense Forces. In 2009, she was extradited to the United States and jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said.

Israel Radio aired an interview with Rosenberg earlier in November in which she said she had travelled to Iraq, was training with Kurdish guerrillas and would fight in neighbouring Syria.

""They are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really,"" she told Israel Radio, explaining her decision to enter the combat zone in northern Syria.

A source in the Kurdistan region said Rosenberg, known in Israel by her Hebraised first name Gila, was the first foreign woman to join Syrian Kurds in battle, in addition to several Western men who are fighting in their ranks.

""After me""

A Facebook page registered to Rosenberg showed photographs of her in settings marked as Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria.

""In the IDF (Israeli army), we say 'aharai', After Me. Let's show ISIS (Islamic State) what that means,"" read a Nov. 9 post.

Rosenberg had consented to extradition and served around three years in a U.S. prison under a plea bargain, her lawyer said. A 2009 FBI statement on the case names her as Gillian Rosenberg, among 11 people arrested in Israel ""in a phony 'lottery prize' scheme that targeted victims, mostly elderly"".

Israel's NRG news site reported at the time that Rosenberg turned to crime after running short on money, that she was estranged from her parents and had tried in vain to join the Mossad spy service.

""She is incredibly strong, both in mind and in body,"" said long-time friend Daniel Lieber in Massachusetts. ""She has always been someone interested in politics and is very pro-Israel.""

Discreet ties

Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with the Kurds since the 1960s, seeing in the minority ethnic group a buffer against shared Arab adversaries. The Kurds are spread through Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran.

Worried about spillover from the Syrian war, Israel has been cracking down on members of its 20-percent Arab minority who return after volunteering to fight with Islamic State or other rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad's rule.

Israel bans its citizens from travelןng to enemy states, among them Syria and Iraq, and officials did not respond to a Reuters inquiry about whether the woman could face prosecution if she returns to Israel.

1707,"A devoted pet owner has spent £300 on saving the life of his goldfish after it became constipated.

The man, who has not been named, took the fish to a veterinary practice in North Walsham, Norfolk, after noticing it was struggling to eliminate waste.

He had hoped it would be a simple procedure but was told by staff at the Toll Barn Veterinary Centre that the delicate surgery required to save his pet would cost £300.

The company boss initially turned down the treatment but changed his mind 10 minutes later and went back to give the go-ahead.

Scroll down for video

The pet owner, who has not been named, took his goldfish (pictured) to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre in North Walsham, Norfolk, and paid £300 for it to have a special operation after noticing it had become constipated

Vet Faye Bethell, 29, put anaesthetising agent into the fish's water before using tiny instruments to remove two lumps from its body. The three-inch pet went on to make a full recovery after the 50-minute operation

Vet Faye Bethell, 29, was then tasked with carefully administering anaesthetic before using tiny instruments to remove a lump close to the fish's backside.

A second lump was removed from his dorsal fin before the fish was returned to water and handed back to his grateful owner.

Ms Bethell said the three-inch fish made a full recovery after the 50-minute operation and said it would have died if it was left untreated.

She said: 'I have never done a procedure like that on a goldfish, although I have done it before on more valuable fish like a carp.

Vet Faye Bethell, 29 (pictured), carried out the delicate £300 operation on the constipated goldfish

'The actual surgery is quite straightforward but administering the anaesthetic is quite complicated.

'The issue was the fish couldn't poo and it would have eventually become toxic and it would have died.

'There was nothing special about the fish. He just liked it a lot. People love their pets - but that was an expensive little goldfish.'

The delicate procedure involved introducing a carefully-measured anaesthetising agent into the fish's water.

It was then removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape before anaesthetic water was put into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills.

Ms Bethell then used a miniature heart-rate monitor to check that the fish was properly 'under' before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps.

She then sewed each cut with three stitches before using a special 'glue' to cover and waterproof the fish's scales before it was gradually re-awakened.

Goldfish can live up to 10 years and this ailing pet was two years and 10 months old at the time of its operation.

The Toll Barn practice opened a year ago and specialises in exotic animals as well as the more usual pets.

Ms Bethell revealed that in the past year she has carried out a string of bizarre operations including the removal of a 12g skin tumour from a two-inch long hognose snake.

She has also successfully taken out a stone from the 5mm-wide ureter of a guinea pig and last week castrated a skunk.

Earlier this year, Melbourne veterinarian Dr. Tristan Rich (pictured) - head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital - performed micro-surgery on a goldfish called George to remove a cancer tumour

The 10-year-old goldfish had a large tumour on his head, making it difficult for him to breathe and swim

During the 'fiddly' operation, the tumour - which had stretched down to the fish's skull - was cut out (pictured)

It is not the first time a goldfish has undergone a traumatic operation to save its life.

Earlier this year, Melbourne veterinarian Dr. Tristan Rich - head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital - performed micro-surgery on a goldfish called George.

The 10-year-old pet had a large tumour on his head, making it difficult for him to breathe and swim. He was also unable to eat properly, and the tumour was affecting his ability to see.

His owners had been monitoring the growth of the tumour which was sprouting from his head, and decided to opt for the surgery which cost $200 (£105).

During the 'fiddly' operation, the tumour - which had stretched down to the fish's skull - was delicately cut out."
1708,"Word that Durex was rolling out a pumpkin-spice-flavored condom swept through social media over the weekend:

The autumnal-themed birth control may well be just an internet invention, a riff on Starbucks’ wildly popular coffee drink. The photo in the tweet above appears to be an altered version of Durex’s flavored “Taste Me” range of condoms, which come in apple, strawberry, banana and orange, but not (yet) pumpkin. There have been no corporate announcements about any new offering.
Several emails to Durex’s parent company, Reckitt Benckiser, and Virgo Health, the PR company that handles communications for Durex, didn’t yield a conclusive answer. A spokeswoman for Virgo Health said she couldn’t say whether the company was or was not actually developing such a thing.
Reckitt Benckiser has been growing the Durex brand in emerging markets, as Quartz reported earlier, and transforming it into a “sexual well-being brand.” But plans for any holiday-themed contraception remain mysterious, or possibly imaginary, even ones involving a certain cult cinnamon and nutmeg-laced spice flavor."

The video shows a message from the game’s lead developer to his boss, and the language isn’t exactly kind.

“Working for you is a living hell,” the message reads. “You have your head so far up your ass, it’s no wonder why your breath always smells like shit. Consider this cartoon animation and this letter, my resignation from your pathetic company. I quit.” Adding “P.S. Your game fucking sucks.”

The note is signed “D.B.G 08/11/14” which would seem to credit it to a gameplay programmer named David Gordon, though Mr. Gordon’s name still appears on the website of developer TriplePlay Apps. If he did indeed quit in August, David Gordon is quite the trooper for remaining with the team a full four months later. (Or they're incredibly bad at updating the site.)

Then there’s the matter of the game’s marketing, which thus far has consisted of poorly conceived attempts at creating some viral buzz, all of which have fallen completely flat. For example, an Imgur gallery of horrible Electric Boogie parody movie posters had been submitted to several different subreddits before most of the links were eventually deleted.

The official YouTube account of TriplePlay Apps doesn’t seem to take the game itself too seriously either, intentionally slamming it as “terrible” and “the worst game ever.” This stands in stark contrast to the Electric Boogie page on the TriplePlay Apps website, where they praise the game. Why would the developers of the game trash it on YouTube? It’s all very strange and seems to suggest a desperation to create buzz, even in a so-bad-its-good way, though none of it ever caught on.

TriplePlay Apps itself is a bit of a mystery as well, as the company—if we can even call it that—has absolutely zero history of iOS apps of any kind, and very few on Google Play. In fact, Electric Boogie was published under the name Qbical LLC, which is also based out of Denton, Tex., the same city where TriplePlay Apps is supposedly located.

A Google search of any of the names associated with the company, from the CEO to the disgruntled David Gordon, returns absolutely nothing. Not a single Twitter account, Facebook page, or—and this is the best part—a single credible image on any website, including those associated with either of these “companies.”

In fact, I’m not even sure if TriplePlay Apps, Qbical LLC, or whatever you want to call the person or persons who published Electric Boogie even has an office at all. Qbical LLC is listed as a “Home Business” in a couple of smaller online business directories, with a single address. TriplePlay Apps uses this image on its website next to “Our Company”:

In the video he says he stumbled upon the game, began playing, and discovered this “secret ending,” but his YouTube history calls that into question. Not only did he view and “Like” the Electric Boogie trailer over a week before publishing his own video, he published a clip 10 months ago for a game called Flappy Beard. The video he published resides only on his account, so he presumably had some sort of involvement in the app or the creation of the video itself, and if you follow Flappy Beard back to the Google Play Store you’ll see that the app was published by—you guessed it—TriplePlay Apps.

1727,"Apple Watch will take approximately two hours to fully charge and deliver all-day battery life with normal on-and-off usage, according to TechCrunch. Those estimates corroborate a previous report that also claimed the Apple Watch will deliver all-day battery life and support up to five hours of heavy usage per charge.

The report also claims that the Apple Watch will only deliver notifications while worn on the wrist. The smartwatch will not ping you for notifications without being in contact with skin so that the device is not disruptive at unnecessary times. Apple Watch will also stop delivering notifications when the battery reaches 10% or lower in an effort to conserve the remaining power.""Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. They require contact with your skin. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it’s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications.""Apple continues to tweak Digital Crown on the Apple Watch, giving the button a ""weightier, higher-end feel."" Pressing and holding down the Digital Crown activates Siri, which the report claims works well and can be used for labeling, directions and commands using a paired iPhone. The goal of the Apple Watch, the report describes, is to return some of your attention away from your smartphone by allowing you to communicate from your wrist on the go.

While both reports this afternoon have provided a closer look at the Apple Watch, there are still several question marks surrounding the wrist-worn device. That will change in less than three days, when Apple provides more details about the Apple Watch at its highly-anticipated ""Spring Forward"" media event in San Francisco. The keynote begins on Monday at 10 AM Pacific and MacRumors will be providing live coverage of the event.

1760,"Money makes the world go round, right?

Lunchtime: it’s that essential break in the day when you get to catch up with friends, check your feeds, eat some crappy lunch line food and, oh, if you’re 17-year-old Mohammed “Teen Wolf” Islam, allegedly rake in $72 million playing the stock market.

New York magazine reported that the Queens, New York, teen made millions of dollars during his lunch breaks, which he used to buy a new BMW (which he can’t drive yet because he doesn’t have a license right now) and rent an apartment in the city. And though his parents won’t let him move out of their house just yet, the president of Stuyvesant High School’s Investment Club seems set for life before he even walks at graduation.

The quiet son of Bengali immigrants has been profiled in his school paper and landed on a list of young money hustlers to watch in the Business Insider. When New York recently caught up with him and pal Damir Tulemaganbetov, the pair chowed down on caviar and green drinks as revealed that they were weighing an offer from a “hedge fund guy” who they said wanted to give them $150 million to invest.

Now, along with two friends, Mohammed plans to launch his own hedge fund in June, when he turns 18 and can officially get his broker-dealer license. The trio also plan to go to college next year, but they’re not worried about Psych 101 getting in the way of their ultimate goal: $1 billion. “By next year!” said pal Damir Tulemaganbetov. “But it’s not just about money. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers …”

Damir likened Mohammed to “Wolf of Wall Street” anti-hero Jordan Belfort, who, coincidentally, also got his start in penny stocks. After a cousin showed Mohammed how to trade the stocks, the teen got hooked on it, but got spooked after losing a bunch of money he’d made tutoring… as a 9 year-old.

“I had been paralyzed by my loss,” said Mohammed, who went on to study hedge fund managers and try to learn their secrets. He graduated to trading oil and gold and while he wouldn’t confirm the widely reported $72 million figure, Islam said his net worth is in the “high eight figures.”

“It all comes down to this,” he said. “What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”"
1768,"An angry bride in India married a guest at her wedding after the original groom fell ill during the nuptials.

Jugal Kishore, the 25-year-old groom from Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh and 23-year-old Indira were about to perform the ritual exchange of garlands at their wedding ceremony when the groom suffered an epileptic fit, the Times of India reported.

Kishore fell to the ground and was soon rushed to a nearby hospital.

The unexpected event enraged the bride who felt cheated that the groom and his family had concealed Kishore's health issues from her, and prompted her to dump him on the spot.

She declared she would marry any person among the guests, who was willing to accept her as his wife.

A man from the gathering quickly obliged and the couple exchanged garlands and completed the rituals necessary to officially become husband and wife.

However, the high voltage wedding drama did not end there.

The groom who had fallen ill came back from hospital only to find his would-be-wife had become another man's better half.

He tried convincing the young woman to marry him, even pleading he would not be able to face friends or family if she refused.

The situation soon escalated into a major fight between the two parties, which could only be resolved after the intervention of the police and elders.

""Both families have amicably resolved the matter,"" the local police head RP Solanki told the Times of India.

""The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad.""

1774,"Gill Rosenberg, 31,said last week on Facebook that she was no longer updating her page because she was headed to an area without internet.

Uncertainty abounds concerning the fate of Israeli-Canadian Gill Rosenberg, who was apparently captured by ISIS.

Islamist websites – some of them known to be close, or even serving as a front for ISIS – reported Sunday that the 31-year-old was captured by their warriors during fierce battles with Kurdish fighters in unspecified areas.

According to the websites, Rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves. The websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture, nor did they provide any proof of it.

The ISIS claims do not make clear whether Rosenberg was captured in Iraq or in Syria. The main lines of battle between Kurds and ISIS are in the Syrian-Turkish border town of Kobani – but Kurdish sources approached by Israel Radio reporter Eran Cicorel expressed doubt over the ISIS report. They said Rosenberg was not in Kobani. In the assessment of these Kurdish sources, the reports of Rosenberg's capture are probably ISIS propaganda.

The Shin Bet, Israel's general security service, told The Jerusalem Post that ""there are no further details at this stage.""

Rosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on November 20 that she was handing over management of her account to ""someone else"" and would be without internet access for at least two weeks, until December 8, she wrote. It is not clear where she went at this time.

If the websites' reports are true, Rosenberg would likely be the first Western female to fall into ISIS captivity. Holding Israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further.

Unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, which refused to negotiate with ISIS over their captured nationals, thus giving the impression of laissez faire interest, Israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists.

This does not mean that Israel would negotiate with ISIS over Rosenberg, if she has indeed been captured – or that ISIS would agree to talk Israel, chalking her nationality up to Canadian alone.

It is worth mentioning that if Rosenberg was captured, she would be the second Israeli – of dual nationality – in this position. Steven Sotloff, a freelance American journalist who also held Israeli citizenship and filed for The Jerusalem Report from the Syrian Civil War, was captured by ISIS last year shortly after crossing the Syrian border and beheaded by the Islamist group this past August.

It is also worth noting that Rosenberg breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq, an enemy country which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter. No matter what has happened to her since joining the Kurdish forces – whether safe or in ISIS captivity – there is no doubt that upon return to Israel, she will be arrested and prosecuted, as was the case of several Israeli Arab who joined ISIS and returned.

This is not Rosenberg's first tryst with adventurism – in 2009 she was arrested in an American con scandal and sentenced to four years in jail. This is however, her first serious choice encounter with death.

Rosenberg was born in Vancouver, Canada, and experienced a family crisis after her parents divorced. In an interview with Ma’ariv in 2009, she said that already at the age of 22 she was pursuing a promising career as a pilot of Boeing passenger planes, but decided to leave everything behind and make aliya in 2006. In Israel, she joined the IDF, serving as an instructor for Kenyan soldiers who came to Israel for home front search and rescue training.

Rosenberg said that she had ambitions to join the Mossad, but was hurt during her military training and afterward had money problems.

She met an American friend in ulpan (Hebrew language school) who led her into crime, she claimed. She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme. According to the indictments filed against them, they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, and perhaps even millions, from the unknowing pensioners.

After a number of complaints were filed, a joint Israel Police and FBI investigation was launched. The probe led to the arrest of several suspects and their extradition to the US, where they were tried. Rosenberg served four years in jail."
1781,"He’s the teen wolf of Wall Street.

A kid from Queens has made tens of millions of dollars — by trading stocks on his lunch breaks at Stuyvesant High School, New York magazine reports in its Monday issue.

Mohammed Islam is only 17 and still months away from graduating — but worth a rumored $72 million. “The high eight figures,” is as specific as the shy and modest teen would get when asked his net worth.

Islam bought himself a BMW but doesn’t have a license to drive it. And he rented a Manhattan apartment, though his parents, immigrants from the Bengal region of South Asia, won’t let him move out of the house yet.

Still, the cherubic prodigy is living, and dreaming, large.

“What makes the world go round?” Islam asked in the interview, explaining his preference for trading and investment over startups. “Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”

Islam and a pair of other young, Wall Street wolf-cub buddies eat regularly at hot spot Morimoto, where they enjoy $400 caviar and fresh-squeezed apple juice.

They hope to start a hedge fund in June, after Islam turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license.

“Mo’s our maestro,” one of the kids explained.

The three pals intend to make a billion dollars by next year. All while attending college. “But it’s not just about the money,” Islam told the mag, which ranked his spectacular success story as No. 12 in its 10th annual “Reasons to Love New York” issue.

“We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.

“Like the Koch brothers,” he added, referring to sibling oil magnates Charles and David, worth $40 billion each.

Islam’s biggest inspiration, though, is Paul Tudor Jones, a billionaire hedge-funder and private asset manager from Connecticut who ranks as the 108th-richest American, according to Forbes.

Battered by losses, Jones would jump back in the game again and again. It was a lesson Islam found instructive when, while dabbling in penny stocks at age 9, he lost a chunk of the money he’d made tutoring. Islam swore off trading, realizing, “I didn’t have the balls for it,” he said.

Fortunately, he turned to studying modern finance, reading up on the titans of trading and ultimately finding inspiration in Jones. “I had been paralyzed by my loss,” Islam remembered of his 9-year-old self.

“But [Jones] was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over,” he said.

And while Islam still needs to rely on Dad to chauffeur him on inspirational drives past the magnate’s Greenwich mansion, he’s quick to quote from the guru whom he credits with getting him back in the game and making him “who I am today.”

“Paul Tudor Jones says, ‘You learn more from your losses than from your gains.’ ”"

1810,"We can already hear the nostalgic sigh.

The new original, published January 20, headlined high : ""Attention, children of the 1990s: you can always pick up the McDonald's pizza."" This was followed by a buzz on the web (38 000 shares on Facebook), both by nostalgia craze for this dish fast food now gone.

For our younger readers, the mega-chain of fast McRestauration had begun to use the McPizza in its McRestaurants (ok, ok, we stop that) in the 1980s In 1991, the McPizza was entering some 500 restaurants, including Quebec. Finally, McDonald's drops the McPizza the early 2000s, as his 11-minute cooking time is considered too long.

But now the site canada.com tells us that two McDonald's restaurants still serve the McPizza in Pomeroy, Ohio and Spencer, WV (West Virginia), not THAT far from the Canadian border in search for intrepid frozen pizza-warmed.

But, hey, the inspector must break your hearts: this is wrong .

How do viral inspector was able to deny the news, while several media did move ?

Here's how he conducted his investigation top secret, so strong in its labyrinthine twists qu'ahurissante intrigues: he called the headquarters of McDonald's.

It's as simple as that. (One might also think that it would be the first instinct of a journalist before spreading the news.)

According to the communications department of the parent company of McDonald's in Chicago (reliable source, we believe), franchises in question are indeed pizza. Except that ""this is not the McPizza, the product of the 1990s that people are familiar with,"" said the inspector viral communications director for Eastern Canada Jason Patuano, reached by telephone.

We are told that these two franchises that have the same owner, are an ""isolated incident"" and that McDonald's allows them exceptionally to add items to their menu. But McDonald's is clear: the pizzas they serve are ""perhaps an interpretation"" of the McPizza, but they are not the true McPizza. McDonald's no longer produces McPizza we do we provide.

You read it here first!

For English readers: The orginial story that ran on Canada.com, and which went viral, claimed that the McPizza was still available in two McDonald’s franchises in Pomeroy, Ohio and Spencer, West Virginia. We contacted the McDonald’s head office. They have confirmed that the two franchises do in fact sell pizza, but that it is not McPizza, the product from the 1990’s. McDonald’s exceptionally allows these two franchises to add items to their menu, but the head office in Chicago said that the pizzas made on-site and are «probably an interpretation» of the McPizza, but they not the real thing. McDonald’s further confirmed that it no longer produces the McPizza."
1814,"In 2015, there’s the quality-fake news and the crappy-fake news.

Examples? Of course.

The quality: Fake news source The Onion quoted fake people on a very real, if unbelievable, subject on March 3, 2015: As the Utah Senate weighed legal medical marijuana last week, a DEA agent testified that he came across “rabbits that had cultivated a taste for the marijuana” while eradicating illegal pot farms in the wild back-country. It’s hard to believe, a drug enforcement agent’s encounter with stoned rabbits, but that part’s real. The fake part: The Onion quoted fake people’s reactions to the all-too-real news. “Rabbits are going to be getting high anyway,” one hilariously fake person said. “Better that it be safe, legal, and regulated.”

The crappy: Fake news site The Daily Currant wrote a story under the headline “Marijuana Overdoses Kill 37 in Colorado On First Day of Legalization” on Jan. 2, 2014. It began ridiculously: “Colorado is reconsidering its decision to legalize recreational pot following the deaths of dozens due to marijuana overdoses.” How anyone could believe such a story, from such an outlet, is still dumbfounding.

And now some more fake news is on the loose — and it falls on the crappy, lowest-common-denominator side. The Racket Report already has hundreds of thousands of shares on its recent piece, “KFC Gets Occupational Business License To Sell Marijuana In Colorado Restaurants.”

Nevermind the story and its preposterous hypothetical for just one moment — what about the scrolling “News Ticker” above the headline pitching other “news” including “Exclusive Photos Of Miley Cyrus And Justin Bieber’s Wedding!” and “69 People Die After Drinking Bad Coors Lite At A Funeral.” Neither of those headlines threw off the 200,000-plus people sharing this story to their own social media?

The Racket Report’s piece said KFC “decided to incorporate a marijuana dispensary with their Colorado franchise restaurants. Franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee. The KFC Corporation was approved on February 3, 2015 for their Marijuana Retail Recreational Pot / Medical Marijuana Occupational Business License. Currently, 42 of the nearly 100 KFC franchises in the state of Colorado have added this ‘option’ to their menu.”

Sounds believable, right?

Wrong. As I wrote a year ago as the “Marijuana Overdoses Kill 37″ story was going viral:

We’re all too discerning to believe everything we read online. But you read this and didn’t check (the site’s) About page or proven, local-to-Colorado news sources before Facebooking it. Next time you see a major piece of news being reported by an unrecognized entity, you might think to question its content before spreading it as fact.

The Racket Report’s About page says “some stories on this website are fictitious.” Gee, really?

The beauty of the weed-at-KFC ridiculousness comes in the news that there is a KFC selling marijuana in California — though it’s a Kind For Cures medical dispensary and not a Kentucky Fried Chicken fast-food restaurant, as Inquisitr reported.

1824,"As if women were not subjugated enough already in Saudi Arabia, the nation’s Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice announced yesterday that “tempting eyes” would be subject to veils if deemed inappropriate.

Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of the Saudi Arabian committee, said in the announcement that, ""The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones. We have the right to do so.""

The new ban on well-manufactured facial features is broad enough to lead to some inquiry on the definition of ""tempting eyes."" Moreover, what is the process by which a woman will be found guilty of having “tempting eyes?” A humorous image can only come to mind with long lines of “tempting eyed women” waiting to be brought before the 1984-esque committee.

According to an unnamed journalist in Saudi Arabia, “tempting eyes” could possibly be defined with these stipulations: ""Uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.""

The unnamed journalist went onto say, ""It's so stupid. I don't know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won't be silent.""

While in most Western nations there is harsh divide between Church and State, in Saudi Arabia no such segmentation exists. In March, King Abdullah awarded the committee more than $53 million to continue enforcing their religious dogma via the estimated 3,500 to 4,000 religious police officers, which patrol the streets.

As King Abdullah nears the end of his reign, there was hope that a younger and more liberal dictator would follow. Prince Naif was recently appointed as the heir to the throne, but after giving his support to the committee, there is little hope that Saudi Arabia will evolve in the human rights department.

""The committee is supported by all sides,” Naif said. “It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.""

The parental “because I told you so” argument lacks logic and rationale, but such is the case when a nation resides under monarch rule. It remains unclear how many women will be found or charged with ""tempting eyes,"" but if there is a great enough dissenting voices, public outcry will hopefully have some bearing on the obscene policy.

The younger sister of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has taken over important state duties from her ailing brother, as he recovers from a mysterious illness, it has been reported.

According to a Seoul-based think tank, Kim Yo-jong has been entrusted with handling crucial government powers by Pyongyang's top political body in September, after doctors said the Supreme Leader was in need of extended medical treatment to restore his health.

""Some say Hwang Byong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,"" Kim Heung Gwang, the head of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity (NKIS) said, Japanese magazine The Diplomat reported.

Other decisions taken at the emergency meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, which was reportedly called by Kim Yo-jong herself, included upholding orders issued by the dictator before he fell ill and placing the army on wartime-like alert.

Kim Yo-jong, believed to be 26, was a shadowy figure before making her public debut as a government official in March, as she accompanied her elder brother at a polling satiation for parliamentary elections.

She was shown on North Korean state TV trailing her brother and party officials on the way to casting votes at Kim Il-sung University of Politics in Pyongyang.

Dressed in a black skirt suit, she was identified by commentators as ""comrade Kim Yo-jong"" and described as a senior official, a rank she has not previously been known to hold.

She had been earlier seen in tears at Kim Jong-il's funeral in 2011 and has appeared sporadically alongside her brother over the past few years.

Analysts said that her ascent in the party ranks signalled the increasing grip on power of Kim's family.

Meanwhile the reasons for Kim's sustained absence from the public scene continue to be the subject of speculation.

He was last seen on 3 September during a concert flanked by his wife. He was walking with a limp at the performance, sparking claims he has since undergone surgery for fractured ankles.

Other reports suggested the Supreme Leader has been suffering from gout.

However, reports from the hermit nation are impossible to confirm and often suffer from South Korean sensationalism.

1856,"Britain said on Saturday it was investigating reports that a man believed to be a British national suspected of carrying out beheadings in videos released by Islamic State had been wounded in a U.S.-led air strike last week.

The man, dubbed ""Jihadi John"" by the British media, was believed to have been injured in an air attack on a summit of Islamic State leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday, Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper reported.

The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was also said to have been wounded in the attack, the paper added.

""We are aware of reports,"" a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said. ""We cannot confirm these reports.""

A speech purporting to be by Baghdadi was released on Thursday following contradictory accounts out of Iraq that he had been wounded last Friday in U.S. air strikes.

U.S. officials said on Tuesday they could not confirm whether Baghdadi was hit in a strike near Falluja in Iraq.

According to the Mail on Sunday, which said its source was an unnamed nurse, ""Jihadi John"", Baghdadi and other wounded Islamic State figures were taken to hospital and then driven to the Syrian city of Raqqa.

The paper said it was not clear how serious their injuries were.

In videos released by Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, the masked, black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of two Americans and two Britons."

Users on social media were questioning whether the “Chinese Democracy” singer was still alive.

The bogus story reads: “Unconfirmed reports say Rose was found dead Tuesday late afternoon in his West Hollywood home after police were called around 3:30 pm for a welfare check.”

It also includes fake quotes from police officers. The article has been shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook.

MSNBC.website was also responsible for a hoax that said Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin was found dead at age 34 a few weeks ago. That obviously wasn’t true, either.

Earlier his year, Rose said that Guns N’ Roses has two new albums in the works. The last album the band released was “Chinese Democracy” in November 2008, which was censored in China due to its title track and reference to Falun Gong, a traditional Chinese spiritual practice that has been persecuted in China for the past 15 years.

“We recorded a lot of things before ‘Chinese’ was out,” Rose told Rolling Stone.

He added: “We’ve worked more on some of those things and we’ve written a few new things. But basically, we have what I call kind of the second half of Chinese. That’s already recorded. And then we have a remix album made of the songs from Chinese. That’s been done for a while, too.

1870,"Inside sources say Apple is shutting down the Beats Music streaming service. The news comes mere months after Apple’s plans to buy Beats were revealed. Here’s what you need to know.

1. Multiple Sources Are Confirming the End of Beats
beats-music-iphone-app

TechCrunch reports that multiple sources have confirmed Apple’s plans to shut down Beats Music, including “several prominent employees at Apple and Beats.” As many as five people close to the deal have confirmed the rumor about the end of Beats Music.


2. Beats Music Might End, But Beats Headphones Will Continue

Apple Insider writes “The rumor [about Beats Music shutting down] would suggest that Apple’s $3 billion buyout of Beats was really about the headphones side of the business, as well as the talent and credibility brought on by the ‘acqui-hires’ of Beats’s Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.”

Entrepreneur magazine notes that Apple paid $3.2 billion to acquire Beats earlier this year. The same article notes that Beats has had a rapid rise to the top: In 2012, just four years after Beats began selling headphones, the company had 40 percent market share. The headphone part of the Beats brand is still very much alive and kicking.


3. Beats Music May Get Rolled Into iTunes

Business Insider predicts that the Beats Music streaming service will be absorbed into the larger iTunes ecosystem:

“It’s more likely that Apple will take the Beats Music technology and incorporate it into iTunes and/or iTunes Radio. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told Charlie Rose that he was so impressed with Beats Music that he “couldn’t sleep” after listening to it for the first time. That doesn’t sound like a product Cook would want to completely kill off.

Beats Music also has a neat feature that Apple might want to incorporate into future products. “The sentence” gives users the opportunity to select music based on their activity or location (think “I’m on a boat” or “I’m on a rooftop and feel like going back in time”).”


4. Apple Is Planning A Mysterious New Music Project

The Verge notes that there are rumors that Apple is planning a “significant music announcement” for next year. The shutdown of Beats Music may be the first step towards making that big announcement, whatever it may be.

Apple’s other big announcement in the first half of 2015 will be the official release date of the Apple Watch. Perhaps the Apple Watch will be involved in Apple’s next music project in some way, though it is too early to say so with any degree of certainty.

Apple Insider notes that a Beats Music app was just added to the Apple TV interface on September 17, making the plans for a Beats Music shutdown seem even more surprising. It does seem odd that Apple would add Beats to the Apple TV one week, and then start shutting down the service a week later. It’s fair to assume that if the rumors are true, and Apple is killing Beats Music, it won’t shut down the service overnight. Expect Apple to give the service a final termination date that’s some distance in the future."
1873,"'It's a nonsense', says official

North Korea has moved to deny reports its leader Kim Jong-un is planning to open a restaurant in Scotland.

The dictator presides over a chain of restaurants known as “Pyongyang”, with international branches already including Amsterdam, and a number of North Korea experts had speculated that Scotland would be a natural target for expansion.

Kim was reported to have taken a keen interest in Scottish affairs during the referendum debate in September, when officials claimed he felt a vote for independence “would be a very positive thing”.

It has also been noted that Scotch whisky is a favourite tipple among the North Korean elite, while tourists can be asked to make gifts of the drink to tour guides and hosts instead of cash.

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, told the Scotsman it “would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland”, while the UK-Korea Institute’s Jenny Town told the Mirror Kim would support “any country struggling for independence and legitimacy”.

But speaking to The Independent, an official at the North Korean embassy said of the reports: “It’s a nonsense.” He declined to comment further.

Mr Madden said the Pyongyang restaurants have been around for about 10 years, and that a significant proportion of their takings is funnelled back to government coffers.

He said they were one of the very few ways the majority of people can experience North Korean culture without making a trip to the secretive state. “But they tailor the menus to suit,” he added. “Customers in Western Europe won’t get a plateful of dog!”"

1890,"Federal officials have called a sitting U.S. Representative a liar after he went on national television claiming ISIS militants were crossing into the country through the Mexican border.

The Department of Homeland Security told AOL News that Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) was telling a tale Tuesday afternoon when he told Fox News that insurgents were traversing the Texas border.

""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" spokesperson Marsha Catron told AOL.

""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

Catron's comments came one day after Hunter ranted to host Greta van Susteren about America's pourous southern border.

""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" Hunter insisted. ""They aren't flying B-1 Bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.

""At least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,"" Hunter added. ""There's nobody taking about it.""

When asked where he got the information, Hunter shot back that he ""asked the Border Patrol.""

An AOL News attempt to reach Texas Border Patrol officials was not successful. The inquiry was directed to the DHS.

""They caught them at the border,"" Hunter continued. ""Therefore, we know ISIS is coming across the border.

""If they catch five or 10 of them you know there are going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

Hunter's constituency mainly covers the San Diego area. He did not say if terrorists were also running through his neck of the woods.

When offered the opportunity to respond to DHS comments, a spokesperson for Rep Hunter provided AOL News a link to a blog claiming sources told it four ISIS terrorists have recently been arrested at the border.

There was no response to a follow up request for comment."
1902,"A marine biologist has killed off claims that a giant crab is living on the Kent coast - insisting the image is probably a well-doctored hoax.

Residents of Whitstable were left shocked when a photo emerged appearing to show a huge crustacean just yards from the coastal town's harbour.

But sea-life expert Dr Verity Nye, who has worked on logging new species of crab, says it is impossible one of the creatures could grow so big.

This image of Whistable harbour from above led to claims that a 'Crabzilla' could be living off the Kent coast

The image (left) appears to show a crustacean the length of five or six boats lurking in the Thames Estuary, but marine biologist Dr Verity Nye (right) says the picture is a hoax

Dr Nye, an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton, said: 'The idea of a giant ""crabzilla"" would very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax.

'I don't know what the currents are like around that harbour or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.'

She added: 'The UK does have large crabs. The biggest is the spider crab which can grow up to 1.2 metres in size, but they tend to stay in much deeper water, about 1,000-metres deep, and are a different shape from the image in this photo.

'Crabs with a ""pie crust edge"", like the one in the crabzilla image, are known as edible crabs, or Cancer pagarus, but tend only to grow to about 20 to 30 centimetres.'

Mocked-up photos poking fun at the idea of a Crabzilla were posted on Twitter after the image emerged

The largest crabs in British waters are spider crabs, which live in waters between 10 and 1,000 metres deep

Edible crabs, shaped like the one in the aerial photo of Whitstable, grow to only 30 centimetres long

Dr Nye added: 'The largest crabs in the world are Japanese Spider Crabs, which can grow to about 3.7 metres in size, about as big as a small car, but again, they tend to stay in deep water and don't come ashore.

'Crabs are amazing because they are so diverse, we have about 60 species around the UK, and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found, but I laughed when I saw this picture.'

The photograph of the apparent 50ft crustacean was originally posted on a blog called Weird Whistable, a collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

The image has sparked a rash of less believable online images, with Twitter users mocking up their own pictures of giant claws emerging from the water."
1912,"Security forces investigating the role of municipal police in clashes in this southern city a week ago found a mass grave on the edge of town, raising fears the pits might hold 43 students missing since the violence that also resulted in six shooting deaths.

Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre said the victims had been “savagely slaughtered.”

Jesus Lopez, the father of one of the missing students, told The Associated Press that a delegation of family and school representatives would come to Iguala on Sunday to get information about developments in the case from authorities.

“We cannot say anything. We are very nervous, but until they inform us, there is nothing,” said Lopez, whose 19-year-old son, Giovani, hasn’t been seen since the violence last weekend.

Separately, a group of students and relatives of the missing young people said they planned to march Sunday from Aytozinapa Normal school to the state capital of Chilpancingo to demand information in the case.

Anger over the discovery of the graves exploded Saturday night when a group of young people from the school protested outside the governor’s Chilpancingo residence. They threw Molotov cocktails and overturned a car after state authorities told them they would not allow them to travel to the graves to determine if the bodies are those of their missing classmates.

Guerrero State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco did not say Saturday night how many bodies were in the burial pits uncovered on a hillside on Iguala’s outskirts, and he declined to speculate about whether the dead were the missing students.

“It would be irresponsible” to jump to conclusions before tests to identify the bodies, Blanco said. Officials said the federal Attorney General’s Office and the National Human Rights Commission had sent teams of experts to aid state authorities in identifying the remains.

About 100 soldiers, marines and federal and state police on Saturday cordoned off the area where the grave site was found in the poor Pueblo Viejo district of Iguala, which is about 120 miles (200 kilometres) south of Mexico City.

Blanco said eight more people had been arrested in the case, adding to the 22 Iguala city police officers detained after a police confrontation with student protesters last weekend set off a series of violent incidents in the city.

The prosecutor has said state investigators had obtained videos showing that local police arrested an undetermined number of students after the initial clash and took them away.

He said some of the eight newly arrested people were members of an organized crime gang, adding that some of them had given key clues leading to the discovery of the mass grave.

Blanco said his investigators had found that “elements of the municipal police are part of organized crime.” He also said his office was searching for Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and had alerted officials across Mexico to be on the lookout for him.

The governor had charged earlier in the week that organized crime had infiltrated the city government.

State prosecutors have said the first bloodshed occurred when city police shot at buses that had been hijacked by protesting students from a teachers college, killing three youths and wounding 25. A few hours later, unidentified masked gunmen shot at two taxis and a bus carrying a soccer team on the main highway, killing two people on the bus and one in a taxi.

Violence is frequent in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory.

The Aytozinapa Normal school attended by the missing students, like many other schools in Mexico’s “rural teachers college” system, is known for militant and radical protests that often involve hijacking buses and delivery trucks.

In December 2011, two students from Aytozinapa died in a clash with police on the highway that leads to the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. Students had allegedly hijacked buses and blocked the road to press demands for more funding and assured jobs after graduation. Two state police officers were charged in the shootings.

During that confrontation, students apparently set fire to pumps at a gas station on the highway when federal and state police moved in to quell the protest, and a gas station employee later died of burns suffered in the attack."
1919,"Lately, Apple cEO has been making the rounds in Europe, stopping at various stores and chatting with employees. Now and then, we get tidbits of info about his chats. The last time we heard anything about his commentary on Apple Watch, it was that he wore it in the shower, suggesting it’s a bit more water resistant than originally thought. Cook also said the Apple Watch was good for a full day of use. Now, he’s saying it will be available outside the US just after launch.

According to unnamed employees, Apple’s CEO says the Apple Watch will be available outside the US in April. Cook reportedly said this to Apple Store employees in Berlin, and said, specifically, that the Apple Watch would come to Germany sometime in early April.

There was no word on if any other countries or regions were specifically mentioned by Cook.

This is another exciting piece to the puzzle for those anticipating big things from Apple on March 9. Though we’ve got quite a bit of insight on Apple Watch, we don’t know it all.

So far, Apple is busy erecting a tent just outside the events hall where they’ll (presumably) give us more details on the Apple Watch next week. Though not necessarily confirmed as an Apple Watch hub, the tent is reminiscent of the outdoor space Apple erected last Fall, when they officially announced their wearable.

Until we know for sure, rumors of Apple Watch coming to more countries than the one I live in is exciting news. In the past, Apple (like most companies) launched stateside before gently rolling their items to other countries. With an expected first-run of 5 million Apple Watches, though, the company might have no reason not to let interested fans slap one on their wrist.

1933,"At least not anytime soon

The internet has been salivating at the prospect of getting stoned and eating fried chicken this week, after reports circulated that KFC is to become a marijuana dispensary as well as a restaurant.

A story on Racket Report claimed that with tax revenue from sales of the drug being so high in Colorado, KFC wanted a piece of the action, with the added benefit that its chicken would see a boost in sales thanks to the munchies.

It looks to be false for several reasons however:

- Racket Report has carried a lot of hoax stories in the past

- KFC hasn't mentioned marijuana on its official news page

- Marijuana sales are currently cash only which would make things tricky for the chain

- Marijuana is still in somewhat of a legal grey area and probably not crystal clear enough for a giant brand to start slinging it

- KFC doesn't even sell alcohol, so they'd really be jumping in at the deep end

While weed might not be hitting KFC any time soon, with sweeping legalisation in the US this sort of thing is inevitable.

Only yesterday, Ben & Jerry's said they'd be up for creating cannabis-infused ice-cream once it's completely legal.

Update: KFC confirmed it. Not happening."
1934,"New audio has surfaced that allegedly captures the moment when Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, on Aug. 9.

CNN aired the unverified recording on Monday night. Six shots can be heard, followed by a pause, then several more. A private autopsy performed on Aug. 17 at the request of Brown's family found that the 18-year-old was shot 6 times, including twice in the head.

A man who lives near the scene of the shooting says he inadvertently recorded the shots that killed Brown, his lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN. The man, who wished to remain unidentified, was recording a video chat with a friend when gunfire rang out in the background. Blumenthal said her client has already been interviewed by the FBI about the recording.

Brown was shot on Aug. 9 after he and a friend, Dorian Johnson, were walking in the street and were stopped by Wilson. Johnson, said that Wilson attacked Brown, then shot at the 18-year-old as he was trying to get away. Ferguson Police claim that Brown attacked Wilson, and said that Wilson was injured after the altercation. Multiple witnesses have said that they saw Brown with his hands up in the air when he was shot.

Police released footage on Aug. 15 that they said showed Brown robbing a convenience store for cigarillos. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that Wilson was not aware that Brown was a suspect in a robbery when he stopped the teen, though Jackson later said that Wilson ""made the connection"" during the course of the stop. The family's attorney accused police of trying to ""assassinate the character of Michael Brown"" to divert attention from his death."

The 17-year-old scheduled the post to go live on her blog in advance before committing suicide on the I-71 highway in Ohio, USA.

The suicide note detailed her early problems with transgender dysphoria and the struggles of growing up in an oppressive household.

She accused her devout Christian parents of blocking her transition and refusing to acknowledge her true gender.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

In a second post, also scheduled, Alcorn wrote: ""Mom and Dad: Fuck you. You can’t just control other people like that. That’s messed up.""

Her mother Carla Alcorn posted a tribute to her daughter on Facebook, but referred to her as ""son"" and used her birth name, making no mention of suicide.

At the end of her note, Leelah pleaded: ""My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say 'that’s fucked up' and fix it. Fix society. Please.""

HCA Midwest assistant vice president Chris Hamele said that the patient does not have the symptom profile of virus and is being treated appropriately for his condition.

It is unknown at this time what the patient is suffering from or if anyone else is sick.

This comes after a Kansas City apartment building in the 3600 block of E. Meyer Blvd. was sealed off about 9:30 p.m. Saturday when the man who lived there became seriously ill.

Paramedics rushed the man to Research Medical Center Brookside Campus about 9:30 p.m. It was then when all or part of the medical facility was quarantined, a source close to the situation told KCTV5 News.

HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year.

Shares of the company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, rose almost 8 percent in premarket trading on Monday. (Get the latest quote here.)

Each of the two businesses contribute about half of HP's current revenue and profit.

The move will result in a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue this fiscal year.

The printing and personal computing business, to be known as HP Inc., will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division.

HP's current chief executive, Meg Whitman, will lead the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will house the corporate hardware and services operations. She will also be chairman of HP Inc.

Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.

Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution.

Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift toward mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals.

The announcement on Monday confirmed a report of the split in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.

HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster-growing businesses.

1977,"Britain said on Saturday it was investigating reports that a man believed to be a British national suspected of carrying out beheadings in videos released by Islamic State had been wounded in a U.S.-led air strike last week.

The man, dubbed ""Jihadi John"" by the British media, was believed to have been injured in an air attack on a summit of IS leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday, Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper reported.

The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was also said to have been wounded in the attack, the paper added.

""We are aware of reports,"" a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said. ""We cannot confirm these reports.""

A speech purporting to be by Baghdadi was released on Thursday following contradictory accounts out of Iraq that he had been wounded last Friday in U.S. air strikes.

U.S. officials said on Tuesday they could not confirm whether Baghdadi was hit in a strike near Falluja in Iraq.

According to the Mail on Sunday, which said its source was an unnamed nurse, ""Jihadi John"", Baghdadi and other wounded IS figures were taken to hospital and then driven to the Syrian city of Raqqa.

The paper said it was not clear how serious their injuries were.

In videos released by Islamic State, the masked, black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of two Americans and two Britons.

1980,"For its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus follow-up expected to debut in 2015, Apple may introduce a handset with dual lenses in what one well-connected Apple pundit calls the ""biggest camera jump ever.""

On the most recent episode of The Talk Show podcast, Daring Fireball's John Gruber revealed that ""a birdie of a birdie"" told him Apple is working on a two-lens system for incorporation in the next-generation iPhone.

""The specific thing I heard is that next year's camera might be the biggest camera jump ever,"" Gruber said. ""I don't even know what sense this makes, but I've heard that it's some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses and it somehow takes it up into DSLR quality imagery.""

The notion of using multi-lens imaging systems to make up for a smartphone's small form factor is a relatively recent development. In March, HTC unveiled the One M8 with a so-called ""Duo camera"" setup, which uses a secondary imaging sensor for depth data.

An interesting startup called Corephotonics, which was profiled by Engadget earlier this year, proposes a different approach. Corephotonics developed a dual-lens module with two distinct focal lengths, effectively negating resolution drops associated with digital zooming. One camera is used for wide shots, while the other is used for close-ups. As an added bonus, the system provides spatial data for 3D imagery due to its lens offset.

While speculation, Apple could employ a similar system, or even stitch together image data from both camera modules, to achieve DSLR-quality high-resolution photos. The company has no shortage of patents covering smartphone camera technology, including Lytro-like refocusing, interchangeable modules and interchangeable external lenses.

Perhaps most similar to today's rumor is an invention for a multi-sensor system that gathers luminance and chrominance values separately, processes the data and outputs photos at exceptionally high resolutions with equally high color accuracy."

The video comes weeks after ISIS released a video in which it beheaded another American journalist, James Foley. In that video, the militants threatened to murder Sotloff next if the US bombing of ISIS targets continued.

The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, was in the middle of his daily briefing with journalists when the news broke. He said that the Obama administration would work to confirm the authenticity of the video, adding, ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Sotloff's family.""

Sotloff, 31, was kidnapped in 2013 while reporting on the bloody civil war in Syria. He had been a freelancer for outlets such as Time magazine and Foreign Policy.

Recently, the New York Times ran a profile of Sotloff. Friends of his told the paper that he was a ""selfless,"" ""loyal"" and ""caring"" person.

2053,"(CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who recently disappeared from public view for about six weeks, had a cyst removed from his right ankle, a lawmaker told CNN.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service told lawmakers during a closed-door meeting that a cyst was found on Kim's right ankle earlier this year, between May and June. That cyst may have caused muscle or nerve damage and prompted him to have ankle surgery between September and October, lawmaker Lee Cheol-woo said.

At the briefing, lawmakers were told that ""European experts"" handled the surgery for tarsal tunnel syndrome. The syndrome is caused by compression at the ankle -- known to cause pain during standing and walking.

Kim is believed to be recovering, South Korean lawmakers were told, but the cyst could recur due to his obesity and heavy schedule.

After his conspicuous absence throughout most of September, Kim seemed to reappear October 14, when North Korean state media published the first photos of him, in which the beaming Kim held a cane in his left hand as he gave ""field guidance"" at a newly built residential district.

Kim hadn't been seen in public since he reportedly attended a concert with his wife on September 3. It was his longest absence from official events since he made his first public appearance in 2010, according to NK News, a website devoted to analyzing North Korea.

Why has North Korea decided to talk now?

South Korean lawmakers also were told that a political purge continues in North Korea, as a follow-up after the execution of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek. North Korea executed 10 party officials by firing squad for charges ranging from corruption to women's issues to the viewing of a South Korean soap opera. Intelligence officials also told lawmakers that senior military officials were demoted for poor accuracy in artillery drills.

He skipped important anniversary

Before his disappearance, Kim was seen limping, prompting theories he was suffering everything from weight gain to gout. His sudden disappearance took a concerning turn earlier this month when he didn't appear at events to mark the 65th anniversary of the Worker's Party of North Korea.

Kim's failure to appear fueled rampant speculation.

Since his reappearance, North Korea has released several photos of Kim, but has yet to release video.

According to Dr. Kim So-Yeon, the former personal doctor to Kim's grandfather Kim Il Sung, Kim inherited a number of health issues, including psychological problems and a history of obesity. She said both Kim Il Sung and Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, suffered from diabetes, heart problems and stress.

After studying the photos, she said Kim's face appeared to have swollen due to painkillers. She also speculated that he has been receiving hormone shots to make him look more like his grandfather, the much-revered founder of North Korea.

""Big Bank Hank,"" whose real name was Henry Jackson, died early Tuesday in Englewood, New Jersey, according to David Mallie, who manages the two surviving Sugarhill Gang members. The New York native was 57.
A beefy, boisterous presence onstage, Hank handled vocals in the early to middle portion of ""Rapper's Delight,"" which despite its extended length -- one version was more than 14 minutes long -- became the first rap song to reach the Top 40 on the U.S. Billboard charts.
Jackson traded rhymes with bandmates ""Wonder Mike"" Wright and Guy ""Master Gee"" O'Brien and spoke some of the song's catchiest lines, including ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn/If your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend.""
Wonder Mike and Master Gee issued a statement Tuesday:
""So sad to hear about our brother's passing. The 3 of us created musical history together with the release of Rapper's Delight. We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house. Rest in peace Big Bank.""
The three friends were unknown MCs when producer Sylvia Robinson recruited them to record the song for her rap label, Sugar Hill Records.

Released in fall 1979, ""Rapper's Delight"" became a novelty hit and a staple at dance clubs well into 1980. It was born from the emerging New York hip-hop scene of the late '70s, in which young rappers gathered in clubs and exchanged rhymes over instrumental breaks from popular songs, most notably Chic's hit ""Good Times.""
""Rapper's Delight"" also borrowed its bass line and other flourishes from ""Good Times,"" prompting threats of legal action by Chic co-founders Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. After a settlement, Rodgers and Edwards were listed as co-writers of the song.
""It felt like a new art form,"" Rodgers said later of ""Rapper's Delight.""
In 2011, Rolling Stone ranked ""Rapper's Delight"" at No. 248 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

2084,"The Force may be with us a little sooner than expected as the latest Star Wars: The Force Awakens buzz seems to indicate that the much-awaited sci-fi's release date may be advanced, presumably amid mounting clamor by impatient fans. While different sources suggest conflicting release dates, they all indicate a much earlier premier than the originally announced December 18.

Rumor has it that director J.J. Abrams is getting fed up with the constant plot and image leaks, The Telegraph said quoting yet other industry sources. Disney has, for its part, started to go after those illegally releasing content from the film, when it asked a judge to subpoena a website that displayed a blurred image of what appeared to be a ""Sith Lord"" last week, the same report stated.
There are apparently very real fears that the story may become public knowledge even before the movie actually hits theaters before yearend. So, advancing the release date may be the director's idea of averting a potentially costly, not to mention embarrassing catastrophe, by mounting a Death Star-level pre-emptive strike on spoilers!
With a quick search of You Tube, fans can watch a one and a half minute ""official trailer"" supposedly released by Disney last November. This particular video clip begins with a helmetless Storm Trooper wandering about what could possibly be the desert of planet Tatooine. However, there could also be dozens of unofficial material floating about the Internet today!
The big question, therefore, is exactly when will the Force Awaken? Speaking at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015 recently, director Abrams was quoted as saying that he is pushing for a summer release date for Star Wars Episode 7, according to MoviePilot.
If Abrams and Disney make good on a summer release, this would put the latest Star Wars flick head to head against other much-anticipated films such as Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, Ant Man and Jurassic World, the report added."
2085,"Item: Vancouver Province columnist Tony Gallagher wrote Tuesday that the NHL will expand soon, and that a franchise in Las Vegas is a lock.

Well, we all know about Las Vegas and locks.

Hey, a team in Vegas would be nice because, well, the Seattle Metropolitans are getting ready for their first season in the Western Conference, and Vegas would make 16 teams in the West to balance out the 16 in the East and ...

Oh, wait, you say there's no team in Seattle? But, but, but ... we thought it was getting a franchise this year, too.

Yeah, the crickets are still competing with all the chirping about that, about how the NHL is increasing from 30 ... to 32 ... to 34 ... or more clubs.

Gallagher wrote that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has changed his mind about expansion and is now ready to take the plunge — and that he doesn't have to stop at just two teams.

The NHL adding more than two fits historically. This is how the league has operated the past 40-plus years:

1967: Next Six, to join with the Original Six.

1970-74: Six, to continue Western expansion and to compete with the WHA.

1979: Four, as the league absorbed the surviving teams of the dying WHA.

1991-93: Five, as the Sun Belt strategy took hold.

1998-2000: Four, as part of the league's reunion tour (Atlanta, Minnesota, Ohio).

There are enough worthwhile markets outside Seattle and Las Vegas (Quebec City, Kansas City, Toronto, Hamilton, Portland) to go to 36. Also, Bettman and the owners know they can tap an easy revenue stream (aka franchise fees) if they want/need to pad their cash reserves."

2098,"Madrid | The doctors of the Hospital Carlos III confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first human death caused by eating genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died of anaphylaxis after eating recently developed tomatoes with fish genes, causing a violent and deadly allergic reaction.

This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the Spanish man of 31, who died at the hospital in Madrid in early January. The health of the young man quickly deteriorated after suffering an allergic reaction unexplained, and all drugs used to contain anaphylaxis have been totally ineffective. The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch, were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.

Mr. Ramos was working as a secretary in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, and began to feel sick just after lunch. A number of symptoms occurred, including a rash with violent itching, severe swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure. The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected a degree add'rénaline but his health continued to deteriorate.

The young man was quickly taken to hospital by colleagues, but the medical staff could not identify the cause of the allergic reaction in the time and no treatments or conventional medications seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was pronounced dead a little over an hour after arriving at the hospital.

The young man seemed happy and healthy when this photo was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before his death.
The young man seemed happy and healthy when this photo was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before his death.
Forensic scientists and experts from the hospital Carlos III had to perform a wide battery of tests and analysis before we can accurately determine what caused the death of Mr. Ramos, and this because of an allergic reaction to seafood, because the only things he had swallowed before his death were bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich accompanied by a cocacola light. They were surprised when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested allergens contained not only related to fish, but also some antibiotic resistance genes that had prevented the white blood cells of M. Ramos to save his life.

""At first we thought there had been some form of contamination of food, contact with fish or seafood during the preparation"" , explained Dr. Rafael Pérez-Santamarina. ""It ' is that when we tested the tomato itself, we noticed that it contained certain allergens commonly found in seafood. We did a lot of different analyzes and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of allergens that killed Mr. Ramos. ""

Several experiments on GMOs produced horrible tumors and even killed rats in laboratories, but most of GM products on the market were considered harmless to humans.
Several experiments on GMOs produced horrible tumors and even killed rats in laboratories, but most of GM products on the market were considered harmless to humans.
 

Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed linked to the ingestion of genetically modified foods. It contradicts most studies on GMOs that have concluded that genetically modified current market crops were edible and without dangers.

A team of scientists led by the University of Nebraska had anticipated this problem in 1996, when they found that the protein of a walnut in Brazil, introduced to improve the nutritional quality of GM soy was able to cause an allergic reaction in Brazil. However, this problem has been rejected by most scientists as unlikely as it could easily be avoided with appropriate safety tests. Soybean genes injections in Brazil nuts were effectively abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused the death of Mr. Ramos was not enough to be tested and risk of death had not been identified before marketing.

The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality, which placed the order of Portuguese origin tomatoes that have infected the young man, demanded that they be repatriated and removed from shops and markets for reasons security. More than 7,000 tons of tomatoes will be seized across the country by ministry inspectors and officials of public safety.

The ministry also made ​​a public announcement about the death of Mr. Ramos in which he offers his condolences to his family and added that ""immediately request further research on the subject, to determine if other food products GM on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population.

2114,"(DETROIT) In a decision that’s expected to send shockwaves through the African-American community—and yet, give much relief to teachers everywhere—a federal judge ruled today that black women no longer have independent naming rights for their children. Too many black children—and many adults—bear names that border on not even being words, he said.

“I am simply tired of these ridiculous names black women are giving their children,” said U.S. Federal Judge Ryan Cabrera before rendering his decision. “Someone had to put a stop to it.”

The rule applies to all black women, but Cabrera singled out impoverished mothers.

“They are the worst perpetrators,” he said. “They put in apostrophes where none are needed. They think a ‘Q’ is a must. There was a time when Shaniqua and Tawanda were names you dreaded. Now, if you’re a black girl, you hope you get a name as sensible as one of those.”

Few stepped forward to defend black women—and black women themselves seemed relieved.

“It’s so hard to keep coming up with something unique,” said Uneeqqi Jenkins, 22, an African-American mother of seven who survives on public assistance. Her children are named Daryl, Q’Antity, Uhlleejsha, Cray-Ig, Fellisittee, Tay’Sh’awn and Day’Shawndra.

Beginning in one week, at least three white people must agree with the name before a black mother can name her child.

“Hopefully we can see a lot more black children with sensible names like Jake and Connor,” Cabrera said.

His ruling stemmed from a lawsuit brought by a 13-year-old girl whose mother created her name using Incan hieroglyphics.

“She said it would make me stand out,” said the girl, whose name can’t be reproduced by The Peoples News’ technology. “But it’s really just stupid.”

The National Association of Elementary School Teachers celebrated Cabrera’s decision.

“Oh my God, the first day of school you’d be standing there sweating, looking at the list of names wondering ‘How do I pronounce Q’J’Q’Sha.’?” said Joyce Harmon, NAEST spokeswoman. “Is this even English?”

The practice of giving black children outlandish names began in the 1960s, when blacks were getting in touch with their African roots, said historian Corlione Vest. But even he admits it got out of hand.

“I have a niece who’s six. I’m embarrassed to say I can’t even pronounce her name,” said Vest, a professor at Princeton University. “Whenever I want to talk to her, I just wait until she looks at me and then I wave her over.”

Cabrera’s ruling exempted black men because so few of them are actually involved in their children’s lives.

2123,"The man known as Jihadi John. Photo: Reuters

The world knows him as ""Jihadi John,"" the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online.

But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolise.

""I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,"" said one of Emwazi's close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post.

""He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.""

A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held.

""There was an extremely strong resemblance,"" Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said after watching one of the videos. ""This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.""

Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John.

James Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September — only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley — that officials believed they had succeeded.

Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foley's killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded.

In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: ""Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues."" ISIL is another name for the Islamic State.

US officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazi's family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice.

The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said.

He was raised in a middle-class neighbourhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.

The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster.

Emwazi and two friends — a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib — never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. It's unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported.

Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britain's domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post.

Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda.

The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam.

Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. ""Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,"" Qureshi said.

Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalise his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait.

In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again — this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so.

""I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,"" he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now ""I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait.""

Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had ""heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!!""

In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice.

""This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,"" Qureshi said. In the end, he felt ""actions were taken to criminalise him and he had no way to do something against these actions.""

Close friends of Emwazi's also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. It's unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how.

One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone.

""He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,"" one of the friends said. ""He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.""

Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. It's unclear what he told them about his activities there.

A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility ""the box."" Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed ""George."" A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages.

Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. ""He was the most deliberate,"" a former hostage said.

Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State's de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State.

About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi.

""I was wondering if you could send me your number,"" he wrote. ""Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up.""

There was no response.

The Islamic State is harvesting human organs to finance its blood-driven caliphate, according to Iraq’s ambassador to the United Nations, urging its Security Council to investigate the issue.

Envoy Mohamed Alhakim called on the 15-member body to look at allegations of organ removal by the Islamic State (formerly ISIS) as bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys were discovered in shallow mass graves.

“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” the envoy, Mohamed Alhakim, said on Tuesday.


“It is clear they are missing certain parts,” the diplomat also noted, adding that a dozen doctors were executed in in northern Iraq, after allegedly refusing to harvest organs of the ISIS victims.

The Islamic State is guilty of “crimes of genocide” of ethnic groups, Alhakim said.

“These terrorist groups have desecrated all human values. They have committed the most heinous criminal terrorist acts against the Iraqi people whether Shi'ite, Sunni, Christians, Turkmen, Shabak or Yazidis,” Iraq’s UN Ambassador said.


After the testimony, the UN envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, then briefed the Council saying that there are numerous reports to support the claim of organ harvesting, which the envoy says is done by the caliphate to finance its cause.

“It’s very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day,” Mladenov said.

“Almost daily terrorist attacks continue to deliberately target all Iraqis, most notably the Shi’ite community, as well as ethnic and religious minorities, across the country,” he told the Security Council, specifying that at least 790 people were killed in January in Iraq.

“Equally worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from (Islamic State) control,” he said.


Looking into the source of ISIS funding, Middle East media outlet, Al-Monitor, claimed that foreign doctors were harvesting organs in Mosul in a report last year based on a medical source.

According to the Iraqi doctor providing the information, otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli, there had been an “unusual movement” in clinics in Mosul, where Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but “prohibited from mixing with local doctors.”


The organs, al-Mosuli told Al-Monitor, were coming from kidnapped individuals, or wounded fighters.

“Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs,” the doctor claimed, accusing “specialized mafia” of being involved internationally.

Organ harvesting news comes as the Islamic State jihadists burnt 45 people alive near the town al-Baghdadi in Western Iraq. It also comes in the footsteps of the recent beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya and the brutal execution of a Jordanian pilot."
2141,"Sons of Anarchy won’t get made into a movie. A hoax article saying that creator Kurt Sutter will launch a film with Charlie Hunnam and Brad Pitt has gone viral.

The bogus piece was published on Empire News, a satirical news website.

Here’s the disclaimer for the site: “Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.”

It had more than 80,000 shares as of Wednesday.

A number of people apparently believed the fake article.

“And Brad Pitt is a bad choice to play John Teller anyway , I’d Choose Sam Elliot,” one person wrote in the comments section.

Added another: “Hope this is fake. Not sure I like Brad Pitt as John Teller. I don’t want to look at the screen and feel it’s another Hollywood movie. Should get lost in the story just like on TV and may not happen when seeing Brad Pitt. Should get a little known actor for the role to create the character rather than buy one.”

Here’s what the original article said:

Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.

Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said.

Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt."

The truck, a black Ford F-250 with the logo for Texas City's Mark-1 Plumbing emblazoned on the door, appeared in a tweet posted Monday by the Ansar al-Deen Front, a jihadist group operating near Aleppo. In the photo, a man fires an anti-aircraft gun mounted to the bed of the truck, presumably where plumbing equipment used to sit.

Jeff Oberholtzer, the son of the owner of Mark-1 Plumbing, told the Texas outlet The Galveston Daily News that the company sold the truck to AutoNation in October 2013, believing the auto retailer would remove the plumbing decals -- a step Oberholtzer normally does himself, but didn't do this time. He says he has no idea how the vehicle ended up in Syria.

Reached for comment by The Huffington Post on Wednesday, an AutoNation spokesman denied any direct involvement with the truck's odd destination. He said the company sent the truck to be sold at auction, and that it traded hands repeatedly before apparently ending up in Syria.

""AutoNation took the truck in a trade-in, we immediately sent it to an auction house, the auction house then took the title and sold it to a local used car dealer,"" he said, distancing AutoNation from the scenario. ""AutoNation was nothing but the pass-through for this vehicle.”

Oberholtzer told media that Mark-1 has received more than a thousand calls and faxes, some of them threatening, since the Ansar al-Deen Front's tweet circulated Monday.

""We have nothing to do with terror at all,"" Oberholtzer told Texas news source KHOU. ""To think something we would use to pull trailers, now is being used for terror, it's crazy. Never in my lifetime would think something like that."""

A photo depicting what appears to be a 50-foot crab hanging out near a wharf in Kent, England, started making the rounds on the Internet earlier this week. The photo was featured on a local curiosities site called Weird Whitstable, and eventually dubbed ""Crabzilla.""

Quinton Winter, who runs the site, told the Daily Express that he'd spotted a giant crab in the mouth of Kent harbor while on vacation with his son last year. “It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws,"" he said.

""Does this satellite photo of the harbor reveal a giant crab or unusual sand formation?"" Winter asks on his website.

Experts say neither.

""I don't know what the currents are like around that harbor or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.""

Spider crabs, the largest known to British waters, grow to about 4 feet and inhabit much deeper waters than the those near the pier where Crabzilla is shown lurking.

2149,"Newly released audio allegedly records the moment that Officer Darren Wilson opened fire on unarmed Michael Brown

At least ten shots can be heard - in two separate volleys of gunfire

Experts have said this indicated a 'moment of contemplation' for Wilson

FBI has confirmed it has interviewed the man who recorded audio

Is another tantalizing piece of evidence collected in the ongoing case

Officer Wilson claims he felt his life was threatened on August 9

Witnesses and a friend of Brown, 18, claim he had surrendered

Brown was buried on Monday in a ceremony attended by thousands

The FBI has been handed a potentially crucial recording that allegedly contains audio of the moment that Officer Darren Wilson opened fire and killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.

Revealed by CNN's Don Lemon on Monday, at least ten shots are heard to ring out during the background of the recording, with a brief but significant pause between the first seven shots and the last volley of four.

The unidentified man who has given the unverified tape to authorities claims to have coincidentally recorded the fatal shots that killed Brown in broad daylight on August 9, and experts who have listened to the audio have said it could prove damning for Officer Wilson.

Scroll Down for Audio

Attorney: Lopa Blumenthal is legally representing the man who claims to have coincidentally recorded the shooting of Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9

'There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern,' said retired Chief Deputy US Marshall Matthew Fog after listening on CNN.

'It is very significant, because if you have a pause there it means somebody had time to think and then fire again.'

In the audio, the unidentified man is heard telling someone, 'You’re so pretty' then 11 gunshots can be heard to cackle in the background — seven in one volley, followed a pause and then a final burst of four.

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.

'He was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat,' said Blumenthal.

'He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.'

Lemon cautioned that 'CNN cannot independent verify the authenticity of this tape' but did say that the FBI have interviewed both Blumenthal and her client.

'We had been told that at least six shots were fired at Michael Brown. In the tape that you have, which is alleged to be of the shooting—we can't independently authorize it, as CNN, because we did not shoot it, but there were more than six shots,' Lemon said.

Nightly scenes of unrest have erupted in Ferguson since Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, more than two weeks ago

Officer Darren Wilson (right, collecting a commendation) has claimed that a confrontation sparked by a scuffle with Michael Brown led to the Ferguson teens fatal shooting on August 9 (left, Wilson paces around the body of Brown in the aftermath of the shooting) while witnesses claim the officer continued to shoot at an unarmed man with his hands up who had surrendered

Funeral: The casket containing the remains of Michael Brown awaiting the start of his funeral inside the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church, St Louis, Missouri, USA, on 25 August 2014

Grief: Dorian Johnson, who is one of the key witnesses in the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, leaves Brown's funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, on Monday, 25, August

If indeed the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on that Saturday afternoon.

At least two autopsies performed on Michael Brown have concluded he died after being shot six times by Wilson after being pulled over by the officer, including a fatal 'kill shot' to the top of his head.

Numerous witnesses, including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, claim that Wilson opened fire after bungling opening his squad car door, causing the teen to run before turning back to face the officer with his hands raised saying 'don't shoot'.

Johnson then alleges that Wilson continued to fire.

Ferguson police and friends of Officer Wilson contend that Brown engaged in a scuffle with Wilson when the officer pulled him and Johnson over, tried to grab his weapon and then run towards him, leaving him no choice but to fire.

Indeed in recent days reports had emerged stating that Wilson, 28, was badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal shooting in the St Louis suburb, including an eye socket fracture.

On Tuesday, The Gateway Pundit reported that the officer had suffered an 'orbital blowout fracture'.

But CNN reported on Thursday that although the officer was taken to a hospital with a badly swollen face following the shooting on August 9, x-rays came back negative for any serious injury.

Earlier reports had claimed that the officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows, according to the source.

A police source told Fox: 'The Assistant (Police) Chief took him to the hospital, his face all swollen on one side. He was beaten very severely.'

The source continued: 'They ignored him [Wilson] and the officer started to get out of the car to tell them to move. They shoved him right back in, that’s when Michael Brown leans in and starts beating Officer Wilson in the head and the face.'

A police source has confirmed to MailOnline that Wilson was taken to hospital and treated for facial injuries sustained during the Brown incident but would not elaborate on the severity or nature of those injuries.

Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries.

Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime.

He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him.

Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox.

Earlier reports had claimed that Officer Wilson was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has come under fire after calling for the 'vigorous prosecution' of Wilson despite the fact that the officer has not yet been charged with any crime.

His deputy, Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder said: 'It's really heartbreaking to see a man elected to an office that high in our state government... come out with a statement like that, that does prejudge the case.'

St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said on Wednesday he estimated it would be the middle of October before the grand jury reached a decision on whether Officer Wilson will face charges over Michael Brown's death.

Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday ordered the Missouri National Guard to begin withdrawing from Ferguson.

Since the guard's arrival Monday, flare-ups in the small section of town that had been the center of nightly unrest have begun to subside.

About 100 people gathered Thursday evening, walking in laps near the spot where Michael Brown was shot. Some were in organized groups, such as clergy members.

More signs reflected calls by protesters to remove the prosecutor from the case."
2160,"A pregnant woman lost her left eye when cops in Ferguson shot out a car window with a bean bag — sending shards of glass flying into her face, it was revealed on Friday.

Dornella Conner said she and her boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, were “just riding around and respecting Mike Brown” when they stopped at a gas station in the the 10000 block of Halls Ferry early Tuesday, KMOV St. Louis reported.

Once at the gas station, Conner said, police confronted the couple.

“They pulled up while we were coming towards the street,” she told the local TV station. “De’Angelas was trying to get away, they blocked us from the side, front and back.”

But cops are crying foul — they say it was Conner and Lee who were the aggressors during the mayhem after Lee drove the car straight at them, according to KMOV.

That’s when one of the cops fired a specialized bean bag round into the front passenger window, in order to stop the car, police said.

Broken glass went flying into Conner’s face and eyes and she was rushed to a nearby hospital, but doctors were unable to save her left eye.

“Thanks [to] all my Facebook friends for your support,” she wrote Wednesday on Facebook. “Im blind in my left eye and they took it out because i got [shot] in my face … but thank god that i can see the world.”

Conner also remained optimistic for Thanksgiving, but made it clear that she feels the police should pay for what they did.

“Im soo thankful that im here too spend thanksgiving with my family and my kids even tho im still in pain,” she wrote Thursday. “I will have justices for what they did too me but I happy im alive.”

Conner’s father, Donnell, also called for something to be done for what happened to his daughter.

“I’m very upset, very disappointed with tactics that they used trying to get control of the situation,” he told KMOV. “I understand it’s a tough job, I understand that it was chaos, [but] there was no reason to fire upon an innocent person sitting in a vehicle.”"
2168,"In a new video posted online, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claims it has captured weapons and ammunition dropped by the U.S. military that was intended for Kurdish forces defending an embattled Syrian city near the Turkish border.

The airdrops Sunday were the first of their kind and followed weeks of U.S. and coalition airstrikes in and near Kobani.

In the video, ISIS claims some of the weapons and ammunition was air-dropped by mistake on its positions in Kobani.



A senior administration official told CBS News on Sunday that the majority - but not necessarily all - of the bundles dropped by U.S. forces appeared to ‎make it to their intended targets.

""We are still assessing the completion of the mission but every indication that we have is that the vast majority of those bundles were successfully delivered to Kurdish forces,"" the official said. ""We're still working through a complete assessment right now.‎""

Because the drops were made overnight, the Pentagon could not say with 100 certainty that they reached their intended destinations.

Idris Nassan, a senior Kurdish official from Kobani who is now in the Turkish town of Mursitpinar, confirmed the Kurdish fighters received the airdrop and asked for more weapons.

""We are not in need of fighters. We are able to defeat the terrorists of ISIS if we have weaponry - enough weaponry and enough ammunition,"" he told The Associated Press.

Kurdish fighters tweeted messages of appreciation along with photos that apparently show that some of the air-dropped cargo - including M-16 guns and medical supplies - did reach its intended recipients."

2188,"When Apple introduced its Apple Watch in September, the company said there would be three editions along with various face options and bands. Customers will literally have dozens of watch configurations to choose from. Only the base model got an official price of $349, however. Now a report claims to have pricing information on other editions.

MacRumors spotted a French blog whose sources suggest the stainless steel Apple Watch variant will start at $500 while gold models could cost $4,000 and up. The iGen blog has been credible in the past, correctly predicting the size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

If you take the view that Apple Watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget, the prices may not make that much sense. Look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts, though, and the anticipated costs sound viable. Apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist. It’s already considered a luxury brand by many and people are clearly willing to pay premium prices for that brand.

The stainless steel pricing is certainly believable to me. Look at Pebble to see why.

Pebble Steel fashion

 


You can buy a plastic Pebble smartwatch for as little as $99 now, recently discounted from its $149 price. The same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you $199, or double the plastic model’s price. It’s reasonable to assume an Apple Watch with stainless steel casing will cost $500 based on that. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap, with an additional $50 to $100 cost for a matching stainless steel strap.

Unfortunately, we’re not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring, as Apple won’t be selling the Apple Watch until then. For now, potential customers have time to save up for Apple’s timepiece — something they may need to do if they want an Apple Watch in gold."
2189,"A five-year-old boy in Torpoint, England, ended up missing a friend’s birthday party, and he did it without any advance notice. Due to his no-show at his friend’s party, the young child was actually given an invoice and billed for his nonappearance.

According to the Plymouth Herald, Derek Nash says that his son Alex was given a “child’s party no show fee” invoice for not going to a friend’s birthday party. The bill for £15.95 (approx. $25) was in his son’s school bag last week and Nash “thought it was a joke.”

The party was scheduled for before the Christmas holidays when Alex was invited to one of his Torpoint Nursery and Infant School classmate’s birthday party. It was being held at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre, and the Nash family indicated that Alex would be attending the party.

“She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.”

As the Metro stated, Nash informed the classmate’s mother in person that his son would be going to the party. It was after that conversation that Nash realized the family already had a family trip planned for that day.

Upon trying to cancel Alex’s acceptance to the party, Nash found no way to contact the party-thrower.

“We did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy’s mother] know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do – he chose to be with his grandparents.”

It was a week later that the invoice for Alex’s no-show was received. A teacher at the Torpoint Nursery and Infant School is actually the one who put the notice in the boy’s school bag, and the school has since issued an apology for their involvement in the matter.

Alex’s teacher said that she would let all staff know that giving the boy an invoice was a “breach of protocol.”

Derek Nash said he then left the school and went to visit the birthday boy’s mother since her address was now on the invoice. He let her know that he “would not be paying her the money” and that “she should have spoken to me first.”

The birthday boy’s mother has since threatened the Nash family with legal action and could possibly take them to small claims court to get the money she is owed.

As for Alex Nash and his classmate at the Torpoint Nursery? He has told his parents that his classmate won’t play with him at school now since he was a no-show to the party and the invoice was given out.

2193,"His gorging has seen him put on so much weight that the tubby tyrant now walks with a limp.

The addicted 31-year-old constantly stuffs his face with the holey Swiss scoff after falling in love with Emmental while he was a student in Switzerland.

A Korean source said: “His intake has increased in recent years with the strain of being in power.”

This has prompted terrified enemies of the regime who have fled North Korea to claim his poor health is down to his expanding waistline.

Kim was spotted limping at a ceremony in the North Korean capital Pyongyang to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of the nation’s founder, his granddad KimIl-sung.

His face looked swollen and he was limping on his right leg, wearing a gloomy expression through the parade.

And Emmental, which is 45% fat, is said to be sending plump Kim to an early grave.

The despot – who rules a country where millions are starving – ordered three officials to attend a crash course in cheese making because he was furious at the quality of dairy products in the Asian state.

But the director of an acclaimed French dairy production college said the request had been “politely but firmly declined”.

The depressed 26-year-old believed there was no chance of ever finding a partner due to his long work hours.

So in desperation he cut off his penis in a bid to stop himself thinking about finding love.

Realizing his mistake Yang cycled to the hospital to get treatment only to be sent home by shocked doctors who told him to retrieve his severed penis so they could attempt to reattach it.

However, when he returned he had lost too much blood and so surgeons were unable to save it.

Yang's friends said that he had been increasingly depressed about the fact that since moving to the city he could not find a girlfriend.

They said that his long hours working in a clothing factory in Jiaxing, in Zhejiang province in east China, meant he doubted he would ever have a chance to meet a woman."
2213,"On Tuesday, Apple unveiled its first wearable device, the Apple Watch. During the company's presentation, we learned a lot about what you'll be able to do with the company's new smartwatch.

But what we didn't learn, however, is how long its battery would last on a single charge.

That may be because Apple is still working out this detail, as a new report suggests.

Attributing anonymous sources, Re/code's John Paczkowski reports that Apple isn't happy with the watch's battery life just yet. In its current form, the watch's battery life will not break any industry standards, Paczkowski says.

Right now, the Apple Watch's battery life is about one day, but Paczkowski's sources say Apple is working on some modifications to make the watch last longer on a charge before its 2015 launch.

This aligns with what we've heard from Apple as well, since a company representative told us the watch can be charged at night. Apple hasn't offered any further comment on the watch's battery life.

Battery life has been one of the biggest obstacles facing wearable devices. That's because a lot of smartwatches run on components that are meant for smartphones and aren't properly optimized for wrist-worn gadgets, Chris Jones, vice president and principal analyst with Canalys Insight, told Business Insider in a previous interview.

""We're expecting so much from these early products in the market when we don't really have dedicated components to go inside these devices,"" Jones said. ""We're nowhere near seeing the best of what can be developed out there.""

2222,"Of all the Apple rumors coming out of the Far East recently, the one with the most legitimacy seems to be Apple producing an iPhone with a 4-inch display next year.

Although the reports are unsubstantiated, returning to the small smartphone market would be a good move for Apple.

According to the Electronic Times of Taiwan, the supply chain for Apple production in 2015 includes the components for a smaller handset than the iPhone 6.

The report states that Apple is producing the smaller model “for the convenience of single-handed operation of female users.”

Even though Apple has turned to the larger smartphone and phablet market with the release of the iPhone 5 and 6, respectively, there are still users who prefer the smaller screens and the ability to use a smartphone with just one hand. As phones get bigger, it becomes impossible to do even the simplest tasks without both hands.

The new phone is rumored to be replacing the iPhone 5c model. The 5c has been Apple’s budget model since its release in September 2013.

The 5c lacked many of the features of the 5s model, such as using the Apple 5 model’s A6 chip instead of the A7 that came with the 5s, not having Touch ID, lacking the M7 motion co-processor and other minor features. The iPhone 5c was discontinued in September 2014 when the iPhone 6 was announced.

According to Pocketnow, this rumor might signify that Apple wants to standardize their current iPhone models with a small (4-inch), mid-sized (4.7-inch) and phablet (5.5-inch) display. Whether the new 4-inch iPhone would be marketed as a budget iPhone is impossible to say at this point.

Apple stayed with a 3.5-inch display for five generations as its rivals grew progressively larger. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, said in 2010 that the smaller screen was better because it was easier to “get your hands around it.”

“Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’ma let you finish,” West said while interrupting her acceptance speech, “but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!”
On Sunday night, Kanye again took to the stage, this time when Beck beat out Beyoncé for Album of the Year. He left before he could say anything, but after the broadcast he made his feelings on that particular award very clear.
Kanye very angrily spouted off about “true artistry” and said “Beck should respect true artistry and give his award to Beyoncé.”
After those disrespectful comments, Kanye was allegedly called to task by the powers that be at the Grammys and he and his sex tape famous wife were permanently banned.
Whether this is true or not remains to be seen. It would be delightful if it was true and send a message to Kanye that he is, in fact, not the guy who gets to say who wins the awards. Beyoncé is great, but she isn’t the only artist out there"
2258,"It was with a healthy dose of scepticism that we brought you reports of a 21-year-old woman who allegedly had surgery to obtain a third breast.

The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida claimed to have paid $20,000 for the procedure in an attempt to secure herself a reality show on MTV.

Using an obvious pseudonym, Jasmine Tridevil told an American radio station she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to operate.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

She claims the one who did agree forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to protect his anonymity, because he was ""breaking the code of ethics"".

Tridevil’s dubious story is not helped by the fact that all the available images of her appear to have been taken by herself, with no third parties present, and that the footage she has posted is decidedly grainy.

And now the internet sleuths of Snopes have weighed in with some pretty convincing research that indicates Tridevil may be playing the media. It points out:

'...The JASMINETRIDEVIL.COM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler, and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa-area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler (whose ""Alisha's Golden Touch"" massage web site now bears legends identifying her as ""Provider of internet hoaxes since 2014"" and ""Specialist in massage for three breasted women""). Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the ""third breast"" photos.'

Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.

However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.

She told The Sun (£): “This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people don’t believe it, that’s up to them.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

She also claims her self-financed film crew recorded footage of her operation, adding: “I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don’t really care what people think or say about me.

“I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax.”

Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a ""quick flash"" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Meanwhile Jezebel spoke to an attending plastic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles.

Over to you, dear readers."
2260,"A humorous report on a satirical Web site done in the style of China's state broadcaster CCTV offers advice to Chinese on how to choose their English names. ""English names come with different connotations. It’s not always fair to those people, but they do,"" the article warns. ""A name can come with a ‘feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are, and where you come from.""

The adoption of unconventional English names in China and other parts of East Asia is the source of perennial fascination and mirth among expats. Any young Anglophone who teaches English in the region could rattle off a host of perplexing names he or she had to call out during class.

One friend of WorldViews who taught English and civics in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou had a number of students whose chosen English names were derived from screen names used during online computer games. There was Orcapm, who was not to be outdone by Skycoolz.

""Sure, have fun and pick a random object or word as a name, but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America,"" the post chides. It offers this guide:

A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms. They’re full of name stereotypes — you’ll find the good girls’ are all ‘Jane’s, the jock boys’ are still ‘Buds’ and the geeks’ are called ‘Sheldon’.

The report also lays out a set of rules governing the types of English names typically adopted by Chinese. Be careful about what may sound inappropriate alongside common Chinese family names such as Wang or Dong. In general, it's good to avoid food as a name, it suggests.

To put bluntly, names like Candy, Lolly, Sugar (think anything sweet), are typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.

It’s not always right; there are doubtless some very smart Candy’s out there. But it’s the first thing that comes to mind.

Other instructions include eschewing the names of famous leaders or celebrities. ""Pick any name like Obama, Einstein or Madonna and you’re going to get some stares,"" it says. ""You have some pretty big shoes to fill there.""

At a McDonald's restaurant in Hong Kong, WorldViews once was served by an employee whose badge confusingly read ""Franco Mussolini."" One hopes he didn't harbor similar dreams of power and domination.

While it's easy to make fun of such unusual naming conventions, it's also hard not to appreciate the playfulness with which these names get chosen. Often, Chinese people pick an English name as a play of words based on their original given Chinese name. The Atlantic offers a few examples from the Cantonese-speaking city of Hong Kong:

Many English names mimic the sound of Chinese given names. A solicitor called Tse Kar-son, for example, has Carson as his English name. Singer Lee Hak-kan's English name is Hacken. Another singer, Chan Yik-shun, is called Eason...

Ho Wai-leuk, a journalist, got his name another way. ""When I was a student, everyone kept saying my Chinese name really fast until it started sounding like 'hoh lok,'"" he said referring to the Cantonese pronunciation for Coca-Cola, ""so Cola stuck.""

For most people, our names are our names and we have little choice in the matter. But the practice of adopting a new English name can be seen as an exercise in self-expression, especially in societies where larger trends of conformity hold some sway.

Who wouldn't want to be able to re-brand themselves or be able to highlight some unique part of their identity? Just don't use that power to call yourself ""Bunny Wang,"" the post says.

Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that the original post was from CCTV. It was, in fact, by a satirical news site."

Say What? ‘At Least Ten ISIS Fighters Have Been Caught Coming Across the Border’

Rep. Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, does not seem like a nut job or prone to wild exaggerations. But last night he said something that should make jaws drop:

Van Susteren: Hold on. Stop for one second.

Hunter: They are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.

Van Susteren: Let me ask a question. You say that they are coming in the southern border, which changes all the dynamics Do you have any information that they are coming in through the southern border now?

Hunter: Yes.

Van Susteren: Tell me what you know.

Hunter: At least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the border in Texas.

Van Susteren: How do you know that?

Hunter: Because I’ve asked the border patrol, Greta.

Van Susteren: And the border patrol just let’s ISIS members come across the border?

Hunter: No. They caught them at the border. Therefore, we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them, you know that there are going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol. That’s how you know. That’s where we are at risk here, is from ISIS and radical Islamists coming across the border. Once again, they don’t have a navy, air force, nuclear weapons. The only way that Americans are going to be harmed by radical Islam — Chairman Dempsey said the same thing. He said that’s where the major threat is here, that’s how these guys are going to infiltrate through America and harm Americans.

Then add this comment by a House Democrat:

Rep. Tim Bishop (D., N.Y.) warned during a recent speech that up to 40 radicalized U.S. citizens who have fought alongside the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL or ISIS) have already returned to the United States, where they could pose a terrorist threat.

Bishop claims that of the 100 or so Americans who have traveled to the Middle East to join ISIL’s ranks, some 40 have returned and are currently being surveilled by the FBI, according to his remarks, which were filmed and uploaded to YouTube last week.

“One of the concerns is the number of U.S. citizens who have left our country to go join up with ISIS,” Bishop said during the speech. “It is believed there have been some number up to 100 that have done that.”

“It is also believed that some 40 of those who left this country to join up with ISIS have now returned to our country,” Bishop said, eliciting shocked responses from some in the crowd.

Is the threat of ISIS terrorists crossing our southern border no longer theoretical? Could the administration really successfully cover up something as big as this?"

This new audio also matches up with the statements made by Piaget Crenshaw and Tiffany Mitchell. And while it doesn't necessarily confirm everything they've said, it certainly adds to its credibility. Both women say they saw Brown and Wilson wrestling in the doorway of the police car before Brown ran away and was shot at from the back. Then, they say, Brown turned around with his arms up and was shot at once again.

2299,"A new survey from UBS suggests that the Apple Watch could get off to a strong start, leading the investment firm to predict sales of 24 million units and gross profit of $3.4 billion from the wearable device in its first few months alone.

In its poll of 4,000 consumers, UBS found that 10 percent of consumers said they are ""very likely"" to buy a smartwatch in the next 12 months. Applying that same percentage to the total number of eligible iPhone owners, UBS believes Apple will sell 24 million Apple Watches in its first nine months of availability.

Detailing the results in a note to investors on Monday, analyst Steven Milunovich noted that the first version of the Apple Watch has a number of limitations, most notably its dependence on a connected iPhone for functionality. But he believes the first-generation device will set up Apple for long-term success in the wearables market.

Still, in the first few months, Milunovich believes Apple will sell 24 million of its Watch with an average price between $420 and $430. That would result in sales of $10.3 billion, and with an assumed 33 percent level of gross margin, would add $3.4 billion in profit to the company's bottom line for fiscal 2015.

Apple's fiscal 2015 concludes at the end of September, so Milunovich's estimates don't include the 2015 holiday shopping season.

Looking to fiscal 2016, Milunovich's estimates increase to 40 million units, resulting in $17 billion in sales and $6.2 billion in profit. And by 2018, his projections call for Apple to be selling 67.6 million Apple Watch units in a single fiscal year.

The analyst said it's likely that the iPhone and Apple Watch will prove to be complementary products, much like the Mac and iPad. But he said it's also possible that the Apple Watch could eventually become the successor to the iPhone.

""Given that two-thirds of Apple's profit is generated by the iPhone, the company has to be concerned about the longer-term threat of replacement technology, whether it be a leap in handset technology or loss of key functions to wearables,"" Mulinovich said. ""With a sophisticated user interface and third-party apps coming on, Apple may be readying for the time when the Apple Watch encroaches on the smartphone market.""

The UBS survey also delved into specific brands, and found that for now consumers are more interested in the currently available Samsung Gear. Among respondents who plan to buy a smartwatch, 37 percent said they would purchase a SamsungGear, while 25 percent said they are waiting for the Apple Watch.

Milunovich expects the tables to quickly turn in early 2015, when the Apple Watch becomes available and shakes up the existing wearables market.

2312,"The three Afghanistan National Army officers who disappeared this weekend during a training exercise on Cape Cod have been found trying to cross the border into Canada near Niagara Falls, sources said Monday.

A top Massachusetts law enforcement officials tells NBC News that the three were caught at the famed Rainbow Bridge.

The three arrived 11 days ago with 200 soldiers and civilians from several countries for training at Camp Edwards on Joint Base Cape Cod. They were last seen Saturday at a shopping mall in Hyannis during a day off. Massachusetts State Police, with the help of the FBI and the Guard, had been trying to find them.

Col. Timothy Alben, superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, had told NBC News earlier, ""There's no reason to think they have nefarious intent, and no information to suggest that public safety is in question. But there's a pause for concern, because we want to make sure this wasn't planned, and we want to see if anyone has helped them."" He said because the men have visas that remain valid for the next several days, they're in the country legally.

Several officials say the widely held view is that they were trying to find some way to stay in the country. Gov. Deval Patrick today said publicly what many state and local officials say privately — that they're not considered a danger. Their disappearance follows an apparently similar event last week when two policemen from Afghanistan went missing during a DEA training program in the Washington area. They were found in New York. Earlier this month, a senior Afghan military officer slated to carry the flag for his country at a NATO summit in Wales applied for asylum in the United Kingdom upon his arrival."

2329,"Seattle/ San Francisco: Google Inc. bought six office buildings northwest of its Silicon Valley headquarters from Starwood Capital Group Llc and Blackstone Group Lp in a $585 million deal, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The properties are part of the Pacific Shores Centre office park in Redwood City, California, about 18 kilometres from Google’s main office in Mountain View, said the people, who asked not to be named because the transaction is private. The company said in its quarterly report filed on Thursday that it bought land and buildings for $585 million, without details. The acquisition extends a real estate deal spree as Google, owner of the world’s largest search engine, expands hiring and makes acquisitions. This month, the company signed office-lease agreements for a total commitment of about $1 billion through 2028, according to the filing. “We expect to continue to hire aggressively for the remainder of 2014,” Google said in the filing. “Acquisitions will also remain an important component of our strategy.” The company had 55,030 full-time employees as of 30 September, up almost 19% from a year earlier, the filing shows. Meghan Casserly, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment beyond the filing. Tom Johnson, a spokesman for Barry Sternlicht’s Starwood Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Peter Rose, a spokesman for New York-based Blackstone, declined to comment. The Silicon Valley Business Journal reported this month that Google was close to completing a deal at the site. Fitness centre The properties Google purchased comprise about 9,34,200 square feet of Class A office space, as well as a 38,000-square-foot fitness centre that includes a gym, pool and spa, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. That’s more than half of the 1.7 million square feet of office space at the complex. The office building addresses are 1200, 1300, 1600, 1700, 1800, and 1900 Seaport Blvd., the people said. Pacific Shores Centre is a 106-acre waterfront campus that was developed by San Francisco-based Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s. It lies about halfway between San Francisco and San Jose. The campus, which includes sports fields and a park, is next to restored wetlands that are part of the San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge. Starwood Capital bought Pacific Shores Centre in December 2006, near the height of the commercial-property market, from its developer and Walton Street Capital Llc, and immediately resold two of the buildings. Starwood Capital paid about $833 million in the deal, its first office acquisition in the San Francisco Bay area. Blackstone in 2011 bought an $80 million junior loan on the office complex at a discount in an effort to gain ownership if Starwood Capital defaulted, two people with knowledge of the purchase said at the time. Blackstone then gained an equity stake in the properties sold to Google through a loan restructuring.

2349,"The Islamic State executioner known as 'Jihadi John' was today revealed to be a university graduate from London who flew to Syria despite being on an MI5 terror watch list.

Mohammed Emwazi, 27, of Queen’s Park, west London, who studied computer programming at the University of Westminster, is said to have travelled to the Middle East in 2012 and later joined ISIS.

Jihadi John has featured in the horrifying execution videos of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, aid worker David Haines, 22 Syrian soldiers and Japanese reporter Kenji Goto.

Unmasked: The ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John' has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from west London

Arabic speaker Mr Emwazi, who first moved to Britain aged six, was reported to have been raised in a middle-class family and occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich, south-east London.

But after graduating from university in 2009, he claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by the security services - and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Mr Emwazi alleged an agent from MI5 knew ‘everything about me; where I lived, what I did, and the people I hanged around with’ and claimed the organisation attempted to ‘turn’ him to work for them.

One of Kuwait-born Mr Emwazi’s close friends identified him, telling a newspaper: ‘I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John. He was like a brother to me… I am sure it is him.’

And Asim Qureshi, research director a British human rights group Cage - who had been in contact with Mr Emwazi before he left for Syria - said he also believed the man was Jihadi John.

Mr Qureshi told the Washington Post: ‘There was an extremely strong resemblance. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.'

Home: Mr Emwazi’s most recent address was a flat in Leeve House (above), which is part of the Mozart Estate in Queen's Park - an area that has seen shootings and gang-related troubles in the past four years

According to the newspaper, in May 2009 Mr Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends apparently on a safari - but was arrested by police upon landing in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Britain.

En route he stopped in Amsterdam, where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia, home of the militant group Al Shabaab.

The Washington Post reported Mr Emwazi - who has also been known as Muhammad ibn Muazzam - then moved to his native Kuwait and worked in IT, but he was detained by counter-terrorism police in June 2010 upon a return trip to London.

They allegedly fingerprinted him and searched his belongings, and he was not allowed to fly back to Kuwait. Mr Emwazi was put on a terror watch list and banned from leaving the UK.

The FBI said last September that authorities had been trying to identify Jihadi John using various investigative techniques including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages.

Scotland Yard would not confirm the name, and Downing Street declined to comment on the report.

Mr Emazi’s most recent address was a flat in Leeve House, part of the Mozart Estate in Queen's Park - an area that has seen shootings and gang-related troubles in the past four years.

A spokesman for the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London said: ‘We believe that the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.

‘“Jihadi John” is not special, in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.

‘The fact that “Jihadi John” has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one's identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.’

In September, it was revealed Jihadi John was known to MI5 before he travelled to Syria to join ISIS. It was revealed security officials had identified him but his name and background were being kept secret to avoid jeopardising any hostage rescue missions.

Horrifying: Jihadi John has featured in the execution videos of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, aid worker David Haines, 22 Syrian soldiers and Japanese journalist Kenji Goto (pictured)

Police and security agents said they also wanted to gather more information before raiding the homes of the fanatic’s family and friends.

Not him: Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - a London rapper initially identified as a suspect - was ruled out

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary – a London rapper initially identified as a suspect – was ruled out after analysis of his voice as well as his height and mannerisms.

The 23-year-old came to prominence last year after he posted a photograph of himself on Twitter holding up a severed head.

Other Britons from Portsmouth, Birmingham and Cardiff have been linked to John, who is said to have overseen the torture of hostages and to have led negotiations for French and Italian captives freed in return for ransoms.

It is claimed he was making street collections for genuine Arab charities based in London at the time he came to MI5’s attention.

There is no suggestion that MI5 or the police had any basis to stop him from travelling abroad.

David Cameron has repeatedly called for the infamous terrorist to be punished for his crimes.

In an interview with MailOnline last month, the Prime Minister revealed how he personally watched videos of the brutal beheadings of British hostages carried out by Jihadi John.

'These videos are absolutely horrific and depraved,' the Prime Minister said. 'And obviously I take the time to see what they are doing so I understand what families have been going through.'

Speaking in November, Mr Cameron said: ‘You should be in no doubt that I want Jihadi John to face justice for the appalling acts that have been carried out in Syria.’

Briton named as Jihadi John claimed he was repeatedly approached by MI5 to become an informant and believed he was being harassed by agents

MI5 repeatedly tried to recruit Mohammed Emwazi as an informant and put him on a terror watchlist to stop him leaving Britain but he still managed to flee the country for Syria, it was claimed today.

Mr Emwazi is believed to have become known to the security services in 2009 when he was accused of trying to fight with Somali terror group Al-Shabaab in east Africa.

The British citizen, who was born in Kuwait and moved to the UK aged six, flew to Tanzania with two friends after he graduated from the University of Westminster claiming he was going on safari.

But he was arrested as soon as he touched down in capital Dar es Salaam and deported by Tanzanian's officials.

He flew back to Britain via Amsterdam and told a friend MI5 were waiting for him at Schiphol Airport and tried to recruit him to share information on extremists, Mr Emwazi told a confidant.

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group Cage told the Washington Post: 'Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated'.

Mr Emwazi claimed in emails that he was repeatedly approached by the security services over the course of the following year but he said he refused to co-operate and denied he had any links to terrorism.

Hostages who have survived being held by ISIS in Syria and Iraq have said that Jihadi John is a man 'obsessed' with Somalia and would make them watch Al-Shabaab videos while in captivity.

In June 2010 counter-terrorism officers, linked to the security services and Scotland Yard, allegedly arrested him as he tried to fly to Kuwait. He was fingerprinted and searched, it was said, and put on a terror watchlist preventing him from leaving Britain.

In an email to Mr Qureshi he said: 'I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait'.

Another friend said: ‘He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere. He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.’

Another friend said that Emwazi later tried to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but again stopped from leaving.

He was 'desperate' to leave Britain and 'was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation', Mr Qureshi said.

Mr Qureshi said he last heard from him that year and said the Jihadi John supect believed 'actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions'.

Soon afterwards he vanished and is believed to have travelled to Syria, where he may now be ISIS' figurehead.

The University of Westminster was one of the 21 university institutions which have been found to promote gender segregation.

Research by Student Rights, a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities, said that from September to March 2013, 46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have been segregated.

At the University of Westminster, at least two events were found to have been advertised as ‘women only’.

The research found that on March 21, 2013 a debate entitled ‘Secularism vs. Islam’ was held by the Women’s Take on Current Affairs Society (WTCA), a Hizb ut-Tahrir front group, and featured Shohana Khan as a speaker.

When challenged by students as to why the WTCA was able to hold events segregated by gender, the Student Union Interfaith Officer allegedly claimed that the society’s events were ‘faith-based’, which exempted it from equal opportunities policy.

In addition to this, an event the following day was held by the Islamic Society called ‘The Concept of Love in Islam’ which was also advertised as ‘Sisters only’. It was logged by Student Rights for this reason.

Student Rights said that when a male student from the society complained about not being able to attend, the Islamic Society highlighted that segregated events were common on campus stating ‘we’ve had many brothers only events too...the information discussed in the only women talks/or notes can be put to the public after the talk...the topics at hand do not only concern women.’

The University of Westminster’s ‘Dignity and Diversity at Work and Study Policy’ states that: ‘The University of Westminster is committed to creating a stimulating, supportive, inclusive and accessible learning and working environment... The University has a legal responsibility to provide a healthy and safe working environment that is free from unlawful discrimination and harassment.’"

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said drones and manned aircraft bombed a gathering of Al Shabaab commanders in a camp in south-central Somalia on Monday.

""US special operations forces using manned and unmanned aircraft destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions,"" he said.

Mr Kirby confirmed that the attack was aimed at leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, also referred to as Abu-Zubayr, and that the bombs definitely hit the meeting of Shabaab chiefs.

But he said it was unclear if Godane had been killed in the raid.

""We are still assessing the results of the operation, and we'll provide additional information when and if appropriate,"" he said.

The assault did not involve US ground troops, Mr Kirby added.

He declined to provide details of the special operations forces' unit that took part in the air raid or the nature of the intelligence that led to the strike.

The militant group is fighting to overthrow the Somali government, regularly launching attacks against state targets and in neighbouring countries that contribute to the African Union force.

Since taking charge in 2008, Godane has restyled Al Shabaab as a global player in the al Qaeda franchise - a transformation that was highlighted when it killed at least 67 people in an attack on a Kenyan shopping mall last September.

The US State Department has listed Godane as one of the world's eight top terror fugitives and, if confirmed, his death would mark a serious setback for Al Shabaab forces.

The bombing raid reflected a commitment by Washington and its allies ""to detect, deter, disrupt and defeat violent extremists who threaten progress in the region, as well as ... threaten to conduct terrorist attacks against innocent people around the world,"" Mr Kirby said.

Whatever the case, the quest for better pictures and videos of Bigfoot, Yeti, Almasti and their counterparts got a new entry this week from Adygeysk, Russia. That’s where a local mountain rescue team, after getting calls of Yeti sightings in the Adygeysk area, went out to investigate. They found what they were looking for and had the presence of mind and steadiness of hand to take a video of the Yeti walking away from them.

Adygeysk is a city and tourist destination in the Republic of Adygea in southern Eastern Europe at the heavily forested foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. The local remote rescue service, part of the Emergency Ministry, received calls of Yeti sightings, which prompted the TV station to investigate. Ludmila Hristoforova was one of the witnesses identified in the TV report and gave this description:
The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we’ve seen something big and shaggy.
Senior search team Andrei Kazaryan was one of the investigators and says he heard the foot crunches and found footprints.
They were 5 to 6 centimeters deep and couldn’t come from a human foot. We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.
The footprint cast and video were given to scientists and to a local museum, which has an exhibit on Yeti.

The Caucasus mountains are known for Yeti and particularly Almasti or wild man sightings, so this occurrence is not unusual. However, some video viewers say the Yeti walks too much like a human to be real.

2392,"SHE made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as an American news channel 10 News revealed Tridevil, who goes by the real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on September 16, with the report also obtained by TMZ.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prothesis”.

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumour site Snopes also uncovered her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone who Tridevil bares striking resemblance to.

However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be sceptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Tridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50-60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 per cent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” he said.

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true, The Mirror reported.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” from her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different ... that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

“Omg ... I done know what is happening but I'm seriously going viral right now,”

It’s not the first time Ms Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women’.”"

As seen on a widely circulating YouTube clip in performance on a local dance show, Big Bank Hank performs with a violet Kangol-style hat and a too-tight T-shirt. The hearty emcee grooves as he rhymes (lip-synced though it may be), lost in music with a fluid pelvic wobble. Next to the more restrained Wonder Mike and Master Gee, he is rap-funk personified. Hank embodies his verse as he raps of out-lasting Superman with a funny line belittling the superhero’s manhood. It's no match for Hank’s “super sperm.”

“I’m here, I’m there, I’m Big Bank Hank, everywhere,” he raps. Again, he had no idea how true that was, though he witnessed the music's evolution over the following decades as the hip-hop style he helped popularize become a form as vital to the ever-evolving story of American music as jazz and country and western.

This line, from the same verse, part of a larger bit involving a sexy reporter, further underscores his import: “She said she’s heard stories and she’s heard fables/That I’m vicious on the mike and the turntables.” That little turn of phrase carved into wax rap’s ongoing love-affair with turntables and microphones.

In the formative “Apache,” the Gang harnessed the titular brass and bongo breakbeat while they shouted, “Tonto, jump on it! Kemosabe, jump on it!” Big Bank Hank then made another claim: “I’m the one who shot Jesse James!”

To call the Sugarhill Gang the “big bang” of hip-hop diminishes the contributions of an entire community that imagined the music at its inception. Big Bank Hank, after all, got his start in the business as a bouncer and managing an act that would become the Cold Crush Brothers. He landed a spot in the Sugarhill Gang when the late music executive Sylvia Robinson tapped him to be part of a pop-oriented rap trio she was putting together.

Jeff Chang’s essential history of hip hop, “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop,” describes the song as standing out amid party-oriented rap of the time due to the group’s birth as a studio creation.


Writes Chang, “Their raps on ‘Rapper’s Delight’ were the stuff that sounded good not in the parties, but on the live bootleg cassettes playing in the OJ cabs and on the boom-boxes --- the funny stories, the hookish slang, the same kind of stuff that would strike listeners around the world as both universal and new, not local and insular.”

“Rapper’s Delight” is considered the best selling 12-inch single of all time, though that’s tough to confirm in the pre-Soundscan era, which began in 1991 (and various litigation involving the track’s unapproved sampling of Chic’s “Good Times” further blurred the issue of numbers).

As happened with most first-generation rap teams (and second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-), Sugarhill Gang failed to sustain a bankable post-hit career, and didn’t receive royalty checks equal to its influence. In the years following the track's success, the style morphed in dozens of different directions, though, becoming politicized through Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, electro-fied through Afrika Bambaataa and popularized through Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys. 

Reverse engineer virtually any rap song since, and the circuitry leads back to ""Rapper's Delight,"" and by extension, Big Bank Hank. His phrasing, his fluid, funky tone, has endured, passed down from rapper to rapper, an invisible but essential presence.

2422,"NEW DELHI: The year has just started and rumours about the successors of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have already started pouring in.
READ ALSO: Apple iPhone 6 Plus vs Samsung Galaxy Note 4
According to a report citing supply chain sources by Taiwanese website UDN, Apple will use a two-lens system in the camera of the next-generation iPhone. The dual lens setup will help the iPhone capture more light, resulting in better photos. It will also add optical zoom capability to the camera, which also gives better photos compared to cameras with digital zoom.

The report also says that Apple will use its Force Touch technology in the upcoming iPhones. This technology, already being used in Apple Watch, will allow the touchscreen distinguish between light taps and long presses, thus allowing the users to interact with their iPhones in several new ways. Moreover, the touch sensors said to be used in the new iPhones can determine the users' blood pressure and pulse more accurately."
2455,"Cristian Bale is eyeing — or i-ing, if you prefer — the role of Apple founder Steve Jobs.

The 40-year-old English actor is in talks to play the charismatic tech genius who gave the world the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone in Sony's upcoming biopic, The Times has confirmed. The Hollywood Reporter broke the news.

Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire,"" ""Trainspotting"") is directing the film, which may be called ""Jobs,"" from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who won a screenwriting Oscar for the Facebook drama ""The Social Network"" (released by Sony in 2010). Sorkin's screenplay is based on Walter Isaacson's bestselling biography ""Steve Jobs,"" acquired by Sony around the time of Jobs' death in October 2011.

The film has had a few twists and turns: Leonardo DiCaprio previously circled the Jobs role but ultimately passed, and ""Gone Girl"" director David Fincher was in talks to helm the film at one point.

Even with Bale, the Jobs biopic still faces questions, particularly over whether audiences will continue to be fascinated by Jobs. While no doubt a towering, relevant figure in both technology and culture, those two areas are characterized by swiftly moving currents, and it remains to be seen where mass interest lies when the film eventually comes out.

Rather than take a traditional cradle-to-grave approach, Sorkin said at a 2012 Newsweek and Daily Beast event that the ""entire movie is going to be three scenes, and three scenes only, that all take place in real time."" He added, ""Each of these three scenes is going to take place before a product launch — backstage before a product launch. The first one being the Mac; and the second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple; and the third one being the iPod."""

2474,"Two Australian men think they may be in possession of the world's oldest burger, after they kept a Quarter Pounder with cheese bought for a friend who never turned up to eat it.

When Eduard Neetz and Casey Dean were 13 an 14 respectively, they took a trip to their local McDonald's restaurant in Adelaide to grab some food after a party.

The men picked up an extra for their mate Jono who never showed. That was 20 years ago.

Jono told the boys to hold on to his meal until next time he came to visit as a joke, and 'he hasn't been back yet', the men told The Project.

Adelaide men Eduard Neetz (left) and Casey Dean (right) purchased this Quarter Pounder from McDonald's 20 years ago

Two decades later it has no mould on it whatsoever

They showed off their prized possession on The Project on Monday evening

Eduard and Casey have kept the burger under lock and key for the past two decades, and though it looks as though it was picked up at a Maccas just moments ago, the Quarter Pounder is 'rock hard'.

'It's rock hard, absolutely solid as a brick' the friends said while showing off their prized possession.

After all that time kept behind closed doors, Casey told the program it was time to 'free the burger' and boys have released a song on iTunes dedicated to their 'Senior Burger'.

'As opposed to a Junior Burger', Casey joked.

They say the burger is 'rock' hard and 'solid as a brick'

The pair horrified The Project hosts when they pretended to eat the burger

They have now released a song in honour of 'Senior Burger' with all proceeds going to Beyond Blue

All proceeds raised from sales of their song go directly to BeyondBlue and Carry Bickmore soon asked the pair how much she would have to donate for them to sample the burger.

Despite all The Project hosts trying to get Eduard and Casey to take a bite out of the age-old snack and the men playing along, quite quickly they flat out refused.

'No way you guys are sick!' Casey laughed. 'It's a 20-year-old burger we're not eating it, no way.'

The men have set up a website, Twitter account and Facebook page for Senior Burger, where fans can purchase merchandise and listen to their serenade to the Quarter Pounder."
2475,"We reported on Monday that a meteor, thought possibly to be a chunk of an Earth-passing asteroid, was the cause of a 40-foot crater outside the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital.

But astronomers and NASA scientists are now casting doubt on that possibility. The biggest mystery is that no one so far has reported seeing a flash of light in the sky that would be expected to accompany such a meteor strike.

""While a meteoritic origin for this crater cannot be ruled out with absolute certainty, the information available at this time suggests that some other cause is responsible for its creation,"" NASA's blog concludes.

Space.com reports:

It's a sentiment echoed by Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Territorial Studies, or Ineter, who concluded that it's ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light.

""We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something,"" he said.

2477,"The North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has not been seen in public for more than a month, leading to rumors his sister has taken over while the Supreme Leader fights an illness or sits under house arrest.

Where is Kim Jong Un?

The saber-rattling North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month, spurring rumors he is ill and leading to speculation over who — if anyone — has filled the power vacuum in Pyongyang.

But there's one atom bomb of a theory being mentioned by Korea watchers that's quickly gaining currency.

Analysts believe 27-year-old Kim Yo Jong, the seventh and youngest of Kim Jong Il's children with four women, has risen rapidly within the regime and may be secretly running the Hermit Kingdom — for now.

Little Kim reportedly went to the same Swiss boarding school with Kim Jong Un and has held positions within the North Korean government since her father was in power.

""If in fact she is running the country — as someone in their early- to mid-20s — to me that is quite alarming,"" Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Victor Cha told CNN. ""It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""

State TV showed Kim Jong Un uncharacteristically walking with a noticeable limp in July at the 20th anniversary memorial commemorating the death of his grandfather, the nation's founder.

After the Supreme Leader's recent vanishing act, health theories have abounded. Kim is ill with everything from gout and a cheese addiction to ankle problems and diabetes. State media called what ails Kim ""discomfort"" in a Sept. 26 report.

He may even be under house arrest, according to Remco Breuker, professor of Korean studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

""We're not sure where he is, or what's happening,"" Breuker told the ABC News. ""We don't know whether he's in the hospital or whether he's been put under house arrest.""

Kim Jong Un, whose pal Dennis Rodman said is 31, saw his waistline balloon since he ascended to power in late 2011, analysts note.

Sis Kim Yo Jong is a senior official in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. But her role might have expanded dramatically if Kim Jong Un is incapacitated.

""She is one of the only people in (North Korea) that we know has unfettered direct access to KJU. At the present time I would not be surprised if she is sole gatekeeper,"" North Korea Leadership Watch blog's Michael Madden told NBC News.

Korea watchers point to Friday's anniversary of the founding of the Ruling Workers Party. If Kim Jong Un doesn't show, expect speculation to reach fever pitch.

2493,"A Russian man was recently able to fend off a bear attack with a Justin Bieber song.

Forty-two year old Igor Vorozhbitsyn was recently fishing in Russia's Yakutia Republic when he was attacked by a bear.

During the ordeal Vorozhbitsyn's phone -- which has Bieber's ""Baby"" as the ringtone -- went off, causing the startled bear to run away.

While some might argue the pop song has the ability to repel animals, wildlife experts say the bears might not have anything against Justin Bieber, per se.

The volume of the ringtone is probably what stopped the attack.

One expert told Central European News that an unexpected noise, like a ringtone, can stop an angry bear in its tracks."
2497,"If 9to5Mac’s latest findings are true, than Apple’s biggest product of the year could be the MacBook Air. (You know, right behind the Apple Watch.) According to early reports, Apple has completely redesigned the MacBook Air, ditching the full-sized USB port, MagSafe connector, and SD card slots for something entirely different.

9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman writes: “The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides.”

profilecompare copy
9to5Mac's artist Michael Steeber designed renditions of what the new Air could look like. Here's a side view of the rumored 12-inch Air (left) compared to the current 11-inch Air (right).

Why this matters: We already have an 11-inch MacBook Air... and a 13-inch, too. So, doesn’t a 12-inch just seem unnecessary? To keep up the MacBook Air’s reputation of being ultra-light and ultra-portable, it makes sense to keep the Air’s screen size at 13-inches or less. However, something smaller than 11-inches will just be too small. So, the 12-inch could actually fill that “just right” sweet spot nicely.

It’s not all about the size
However, if 9to5Mac’s design estimates are correct, this is the start of a new design shift for the MacBook Air. We’ll see features that are slimmer and more compact than before, with an edge-to-edge keyboard, a modified trackpad, and a thinner profile (yes, the Air will actually be getting smaller).

Apple could also introduce USB Type-C on the new Air, which means it would no longer need a MagSafe port, as reports on USB Type-C indicate that it can be used to power computers. 9to5Mac believes this single port could be used as a sort of hub, allowing users to plug in multiple devices to the Air.

Of course, this is just speculation at this point—Apple has yet to announce a new MacBook Air officially—but 9to5Mac’s artist renditions are pretty cool. Check out their full report for more details."
2515,"Et si Dieu était une femme? C'est ce qu'affirme le père John Micheal O’neal, prêtre de 71 ans dans le Massachusetts. Le 29 janvier dernier, il est amené d’urgence à l’hôpital, victime d'une crise cardiaque. Quelques minutes après son arrivée, il est déclaré cliniquement mort. Les médecins parviennent finalement à le «ramener à la vie en redémarrant son cœur, 48 minutes après qu’il s’est arrêté, rapportent plusieurs médias américains.
Le religieux américain a prétendu avoir des souvenirs clairs de ce qui lui était arrivé pendant ces longues minutes de mort clinique. Il explique avoir eu la sensation d’être sorti de son corps, entouré par une lumière écrasante, et éprouvé un sentiment d’intense amour autour de lui. Des sensations souvent évoquées par ceux qui ont fait l’expérience de mort imminente (EMI).  
Dieu, une «figure maternelle chaleureuse et réconfortante»
Mais John Micheal O’neal va plus loin. Il affirme être monté au ciel et avoir rencontré le Tout-puissant. Celui-ci serait un «être de lumière», mais surtout, une «figure maternelle chaleureuse et réconfortante».
«Sa présence était à la fois immense et réconfortante», déclare le prêtre catholique. «Elle avait une voix douce et apaisante et sa présence était aussi rassurante que l'étreinte d'une mère. Le fait que Dieu soit une Sainte=Mère au lieu d'un Saint-Père ne me dérange pas, elle est tout ce que j'espérais et même plus encore».

2533,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump told France’s new president that he was “my guy” in the recent election, a French official said Thursday. The record shows only favorable words from Trump for centrist Emmanuel Macron’s opponent, the defeated far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.

A look at Trump’s views, before and now, on this month’s French vote:

TRUMP to Macron at a lunch meeting in Brussels on Thursday, according to a French official: “You were my guy” in the French campaign. Trump also said he didn’t endorse Le Pen, according to the official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and requested anonymity.

THE FACTS: Trump may never have explicitly endorsed any candidate in France’s election, but he had only nice things to say about one candidate: Le Pen. Whatever views he may have expressed privately are unknown.

In an April 21 interview with The Associated Press, Trump said he believed an attack that week on police officers in Paris would help the National Front leader because the violence played to her strengths.

“She’s the strongest on borders, and she’s the strongest on what’s been going on in France,” Trump said in the Oval Office interview. “Whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism, and whoever is the toughest at the borders, will do well in the election.”

By contrast, Trump never spoke publicly about Macron before the vote. Former President Barack Obama endorsed Macron.

While Le Pen had echoed some of Trump’s hardline rhetoric on immigration, the U.S. leader’s words of support were surprising.

Le Pen had distanced herself from her father, National Front party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has been convicted of crimes related to anti-Semitism and mocked the Holocaust as a “detail” of history. But she still drew criticism for denying during the campaign that the French state was responsible for the roundup of Jews during World War II, and maintained an inner circle of old friends from her student days that included members of a radical group known for violence and anti-Semitism.

Trump called Macron after his resounding victory. He also tweeted congratulations to the 39-year-old winner, saying he looked forward to working with him."

During the meeting wherein the Washington Post asserted that Jared Kushner proposed a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia, it was actually the Russians who proposed it, a source close to Kushner informed Fox News.

The source alleges that the permanent back channel “was never discussed”. What really happened was the proposal of a one-off call about Syria.

Fox News reports:

A December meeting between Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and one of the senior advisers in the Trump administration, and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at Trump Tower focused on Syria, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News Monday.

During the meeting the Russians broached the idea of using a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia, not Kushner, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News. That follows a recent report from The Washington Post alleging that Kushner wanted to develop a secure, private line with Russia.

The idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed, according to the source. Instead, only a one-off for a call about Syria was raised in the conversation.

In addition, the source told Fox News the December meeting focused on Russia’s contention the Obama administration’s policy on Syria was deeply flawed.

JARED KUSHNER WANTED SECRET COMMUNICATIONS CHANNEL WITH RUSSIA, NEW REPORT ALLEGES

Details of the meeting follow a NBC report that Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka, is currently under FBI scrutiny as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Kushner suggested the use of Russian diplomatic facilities as a way to shield pre-inauguration discussions with Kislyak from monitoring, according to The Post.

Kislyak allegedly then relayed the suggestion to his superiors in Moscow. That was based on intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U.S. officials, although neither the meeting nor the communications of the Americans involved were under U.S. surveillance, officials told the Post.

The source has told Fox News that Kushner is eager to tell Congress about the meeting and any others of interest."
2579,"One of the main lines of evidence used by the Obama administration to justify its global warming regulations doesn’t exist in the real world, according to a new report by climate researchers.

Researchers analyzed temperature observations from satellites, weather balloons, weather stations and buoys and found the so-called “tropical hotspot” relied upon by the EPA to declare carbon dioxide a pollutant “simply does not exist in the real world.”

They found that once El Ninos are taken into account, “there is no ‘record setting’ warming to be concerned about.”

“These analysis results would appear to leave very, very little doubt but that EPA’s claim of a Tropical Hot Spot (THS), caused by rising atmospheric CO2 levels, simply does not exist in the real world,” reads the report by economist James Wallace, climatologist John Christy and meteorologist Joseph D’Aleo.

“Also critically important, even on an all-other-things-equal basis, this analysis failed to find that the steadily rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations have had a statistically significant impact on any of the 13 critically important temperature time series analyzed,” they wrote.

When EPA released its CO2 endangerment finding in 2009, it used three lines of evidence to bolster its argument that greenhouse gases threatened human health through global warming.
The crux of EPA’s argument rested on the existence of a “tropical hotspot” where global warming would be most apparent. That is, there should be enhanced warming in the tropical troposphere — the “fingerprint” of global warming.

EPA’s endangerment finding is the legal basis for agency global warming regulations, including the Clean Power Plan (CPP) now being fought over in federal court. CPP aims to cut power plant carbon dioxide emissions 32 percent by 2030 and could cost $41 billion a year, according to independent estimates.

D’Aleo and his colleagues looked at the data and controlled for El Ninos and La Ninas. What they found was that once natural oceanic warming and cooling events are accounted for, there’s no warming trend.

“El Nino is not by any means new,” D’Aleo told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “The El Ninos and La Ninas do not occur at a regular frequency but tend to cluster as we showed in our paper.”

Tropospheric temperatures are mainly measured by satellites and weather balloons, which collect data from the lowest few miles of the atmosphere. Satellites already show only slight warming since 1979, but they are sensitive to El Ninos and La Ninas.

Removing El Ninos and La Ninas from tropospheric temperatures creates “temperature time series each having a flat trend.” Basically, D’Aleo and his colleagues found oceanic warming events are responsible for virtually all the warming since 1977 when El Ninos became more frequent and stronger.

On the flip side, the recent “hiatus” in global warming can be explained by more frequent La Ninas, according to D’Aleo.

“It is an accepted fact that El Ninos bring global warmth and La Ninas cooling,” D’Aleo said. “It is thus not at all surprising that the period from 1947 to 1977 brought cooling, 1977 to 1997 warming and we had a flat trend from 1997 to current.”

With El Ninos and La Ninas adjusted out of the data, only volcanoes are left — base on EPA assumptions — to impact the climate, and D’Aleo’s report acknowledges “it was still possible that the volcanic activity was hiding CO2’s impact.”

Volcanic aerosols can have a cooling effect on global average temperature; the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo caused a dip in satellite temperature data that lasted for a couple years.

“The temperature data measurements that were analyzed were taken by many different entities using balloons, satellites, buoys and various land based techniques,” reads the report. “Needless to say, if regardless of data source, the results are the same, the analysis findings should be considered highly credible.”

Climate scientists have been debating for years over the existence of the “tropical hotspot.”

Christy, who co-runs the premier satellite temperature dataset at the University of Alabama in Huntsville with climatologist Roy Spencer, has presented evidence that climate models overpredicted warming in the tropical troposphere.

Ross McKitrick, an environmental economist at the University of Guelph in Canada, also ran the numbers and found climate models overestimated warming in the tropical troposphere.

McKitrick provided evidence of a phase shift in 1977 from dominant El Ninas to El Ninos — just like D’Aleo, Christy and Williams found.

“Over the 55-years from 1958 to 2012, climate models not only significantly over-predict observed warming in the tropical troposphere, but they represent it in a fundamentally different way than is observed,” McKitrick wrote in a 2014 study."
