2,"A bereaved Afghan mother took revenge on the Taliban after watching them kill her son in an ambush. Reza Gul killed 25 Taliban fighters and injured five others in a seven-hour gunbattle in Farah province.

Gul, who was joined by her daughter and daughter in-law, engaged the Taliban using AK-47s and grenades, despitenever before having used a weapon.

The embattled mother told Tolo news, a 24-hour Afghan news broadcaster, she was awakened by shots early Tuesday. After seeing that her son had been killed, Gul and the other two women fought back.

“I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon,” Gul told Tolo News. “I went to the check post and began shooting back.”

Seema, her daughter-in-law, added: “The fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons. We were committed to fight until the last bullet.”

Gul said that the battlefield was covered in Talib fighters after the deadly exchange ended.

While the Taliban have not publicly commented on the incident, the Afghan government labeled it a symbol of a public uprising against the Taliban.

Taliban and other groups have regained large swathes of the country as U.S. and NATO forces slowly pull out troops after 14 years of war. The Taliban have targeted government and foreign infrastructure as the group attempts to claw back power it lost in 2001.

While the Taliban have made key gains in rural regions, members continue to employ suicide bomber tactics in well protected towns and cities. Earlier this week, 50 people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated a vest during a volleyball competition in Yahyakahil, Paktika province.

That particular attack prompted President Ashraf Ghani to order a complete overview of the country’s defense forces and to rethink the ban on nighttime raids, which were outlawed by his predecessor, Hamid Karzai."

It was super low quality, therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because I was on hold for 20+ minutes for something so simple (iPhone didn’t turn on, needed to set up a repair as in my country no Apple Store = have to send it to another country),” Reddit user lerde writes.

“Much to my surprise a lady from Cupertino called me up the next day, saying she’d received a concerning email from Tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone, that Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done. She assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections,” lerde writes. “The next time I called Apple, the hold music was indeed very pleasant.”

28,"In designing its first wearable device in the Apple Watch, Apple looked to incorporate a variety of highly advanced health functions with an eye on creating a holistic monitoring device, but ultimately scrapped those plans due to technological and regulatory hurdles.

According to The Wall Street Journal, sources claim Apple Watch was supposed to be much more than the device unveiled last year and slated to launch in April. Specifically, Apple executives wanted to produce a cutting edge health-monitoring tool, one capable of measuring a user's blood pressure, heart rate, stress level and more, said people familiar with the matter.

The publication says the setbacks forced Apple executives into a corner when it came to marketing the device to the general consumer. As it stands, Apple Watch boasts a variety of sensors, including accelerometers, touch inputs and a bespoke optical heart rate sensor, the latter of which connects to the iOS Health app for fitness and wellness tracking. While polished and presented in a slick package, Apple Watch is powered by technology on a par with competing devices running flavors of Android.

Aside from catchall smartwatch devices, a number of standalone solutions for off-the-shelf medical style monitoring already exist in the form of products — usually wrist-worn — from smaller manufacturers and startups. For example, the W/Me band incorporates a specialized sensor to measure a user's autonomic nervous system for keeping track of stress levels, while the latest products from Fitbit tout all-day heart rate monitoring.

Apple started development of its Watch four years ago, with an eye on health and fitness, but the project was quickly dubbed a ""black hole"" for sucking in resources. Advanced technology and component reliability failed to meet Apple's rigorous standards, sources said.

For example, skin conductivity sensors showed promise in early designs, but later testing showed actual results varied person to person, with everything from hairy arms to strap tightness contributing to unreliable readings. The company also investigated incorporating blood pressure and blood oxygen measurement features, but results were inconsistent.

Apple is seemingly investing on health-minded devices and programs, as evidenced by recently discovered job postings, but will take a more mainstream approach for the first generation Watch. Instead of focusing exclusively on health and fitness, the device is being positioned as a niche-filling fashion accessory, iOS compatible smartwatch, iPhone companion and daily communicator, among others.

Apple Watch does, however, sport a few Apple-only features, including Apple Pay integration and WatchKit development tools that are expected to foster a rich ecosystem of bite-sized apps later this year."
31,"The picture of a possible ""Crabzilla"" measuring about 50 feet has surfaced after such creature was allegedly spotted at a harbor in the United Kingdom. The oddity has led many to ask: could this be real or simply a hoax?

The photograph of the monster crab first came out in the website Weird Whitstable, which collects exciting and unusual pictures of sightings reported in the town of Whitstable, Kent.

Quinton Winter, the curator of the website, reveals that a follower sent him the picture of the giant crab lurking at the Kent harbor. The satellite image of the crab shows the creature to be about 50 feet in size, more than four times bigger than the biggest crabs alive on the planet. Winter initially thought the crab-like image was due to some sort of sand formation; however, he now believes that it is an actual crab.

Winter says that he may have also seen the gigantic crab when he went for crabbing with his son in the summer of 2013.

""At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'that's a funny looking bit of driftwood,"" said Winter. ""It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws. Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.""

Japanese spider crabs, found in the waters around Japan, are the biggest known living crab species is the world. The Japanese spider crab can weigh up to 12 kilograms (26.45 pounds) and its leg span can reach up to 3.8 meters (about 12 feet).

Even though some people believe that the giant crab image is real, there are some who believe it is a hoax and may be the result of computer image manipulation. The image could be an enlarged picture of an edible crab with the scientific name of Cancer pagurus, which is generally found in the waters surrounding the British Isles. However, this crab species is not as big as 50 feet but measures just about 10 inches and weighs just around six pounds.

Check out the picture of the giant crab of Weird Whitstable and decide for yourself: is it real or a hoax?"
33,"Early Tuesday morning, Dornella Conner was “riding around, respecting Mike Brown” with her boyfriend De’Angelas Lee when she was injured with flying shards of glass after police officers fired into her car with specialized “bean bag” bullets, designed to help control rioters and unruly protesters. According to Conner, she and Lee pulled up at a gas station, and were blocked off on all sides by approaching police officers before one of them fired their weapon, injuring Conner in her face. However, according to police officers, Conner’s boyfriend, De’Angelas, aggressively drove the car straight at them, which is why they decided to fire the bean bag into the car to stop their approach. Broken glass from the shattered car window flew into Conner’s eye, and despite being rushed to a hospital shortly after, doctors were unable to save her left eye.

She released a statement to Facebook:

According to CNN, a Yorkville Endoscopy staff member told investigators the photograph was taken while Rivers was in the procedure room.

The 81-year-old entertainer went to the clinic to undergo a scheduled endoscopy by gastroenterologist and the clinic's medical director Dr. Lawrence Cohen, according to reports. After that procedure, CNN reports Rivers also underwent an unauthorized vocal cord biopsy performed by a physician, who hasn't been identified.

57,"After sending a tweet that many observers said they believed was directed at Bill Cosby, a Twitter account claiming to be that of “The Cosby Show” actress Lisa Bonet was suspended. The account was suspended Saturday following a Nov. 21 tweet directed to no one in particular that piqued the attention of many in the media, including the New York Post and Fox News.

“According to the karma of past actions, one’s destiny unfolds, even though everyone wants to be so lucky… Nothing stays in the dark 4ever!” the tweet said.

Bonet starred as Denise Huxtable on “Cosby” and many said they believed the tweet was directed at her former on-screen father, who has of late suffered a devastating blow to his public persona. Public anger prompted numerous partners to sever relationships with the embattled actor and comedian as a result of allegations he raped more than a dozen women during his career that were reignited by comedian Hannibal Buress last month.

The account is no longer on Twitter, but it featured the Twitter handle @Lilakoi_Moon and used “Lisa Bonet” in its full name field. It also included a photo of the actress. Bonet changed her name to Lilakoi Moon while still acting under the name Lisa Bonet.

Cosby and Bonet were rumored to have had a falling out during the 1980s because Cosby did not approve of her decision to shoot a sexually explicit scene in the 1987 R-rated film “Angel Heart” or to pose topless for a photoshoot with Interview magazine. Bonet left “The Cosby Show” to shoot the spin-off “A Different World” but returned after giving birth. She parted ways with the show again in 1991 and chose not to be part of a reunion special.

The @Lilakoi_Moon account had been on the social networking service for a number of months, and before being shut down had garnered thousands of followers. The user sent tweets to verified Twitter accounts belonging to actor Kadeem Hardison and other members of the “Different World” cast. Representatives of Twitter did not immediately respond to requests from International Business Times to explain why the account was suspended.

An account said to be that of Cree Summer, the actress who played Winifred ""Freddie"" Brooks on “A Different World,” told followers that the @Lilakoi_Moon was fake in a tweet July 10.

69,"The group calling itself the Islamic State (also ISIS or ISIL) has released a video purporting to show the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff, according to the Site Intelligence Group.

Sotloff is the second American journalist brutally murdered by ISIS in less than two weeks. On Aug. 20, the group released a video showing the execution of James Foley, during which they also promised to execute Sotloff if the U.S. did not cease airstrikes against the group in Iraq.

The video of Sotloff, which was posted by Site, was entitled, ""A Second Message To America.""

Based on a portion of the footage that was posted by Site and seen by Business Insider, it begins with footage of President Barack Obama speaking about the airstrikes the U.S. launched against Islamic State last month. It goes on to show Sotloff being held at knifepoint in an orange jumpsuit and behing forced to deliver a statement, a similar procedure for Foley in the video of his execution.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday afternoon he was not immediately ""in a position to determine the authenticity of the video."" He said the White House's thoughts and prayers were with Sotloff's family.

""If the video is genuine, we are sickened,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. She said the intelligence community would work quickly to determine the video's authenticity.

In the video released Tuesday by ISIS — entitled ""A Second Message to America — Sotloff appears dressed in an orange jumpsuit before he is executed by an ISIS member.

Sotloff was kidnapped by militants upon crossing into Syria a little more than a year ago. He had been freelancing for Time and Foreign Policy magazines. Last week, his mother made an emotional plea to his captors and the Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

U.S. officials have said that Sotloff and Foley were among fewer than 10 Westerners being held hostage by the group. When asked again on Tuesday, Psaki said ""a few"" U.S. citizens were being held by ISIS.

This is a breaking news story and will be updated as we learn more information.

71,"The next iPhone's camera may see a massive leap in image quality, Apple Insider reports — if it gets the rumoured inclusion of optical image zoom for the first time.

The Apple news site is basing its report off rumours heard by the Japanese-language UDN and its ""ever-reliable sources in the Asian supply chain.""

Currently the iPhone — like almost every other smartphone — makes use of digital zoom. With digital zoom, zooming in doesn't add any extra detail to your photo — it just enlarges and enhances what's already captured. In contrast, optical zoom uses an actual lens to to magnify and capture significantly more detail without sacrificing image quality.

The camera in the iPhone 6 is already highly praised, but the rumoured new version will reportedly make use of a new dual-lens system to aid magnification — like compact cameras and professional SLRs.

It's a rumour in keeping with what we've already heard about the next iPhone. Blogger and developer John Gruber, who has an excellent track record on Apple product news, said that the next model may have ""the biggest camera jump ever.""

""I've heard that it's some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses,"" Gruber said, ""and it somehow takes it up into DSLR quality imagery.""

And that's not the only new prediction about the next iPhone from UDN. The Apple smartphone is also reportedly to include ""Force Touch,"" a pressure-sensitive touchscreen which is also included in the Apple Watch. A user could press lightly on an app to load it, or push more forcefully in order to bring up more options, for example."
73,"Last Tuesday, College Humor posted a photo series titled ""This Is The Most Passive-Aggressive Office Battle We've Ever Seen"" depicting an exchange of break room notes that escalates into a full-scale sandwich hostage crisis. It was pretty funny, but also totally fake, as made clear by the extensive watermarks and ""CH Staff"" byline, an attribution the site reserves for original works like last year's phony Breaking Bad finale script.
The obvious joke wasn't quite as obvious, however, when someone cropped out the ""College Humor"" watermarks and posted the images on Reddit, the bottomless well from which all deadline-facing bloggers drink. From there the clearly staged photos were picked up far and wide, earning credulous coverage from the Daily Mail, the Mirror and Fox 32 Chicago, which ran the headline ""Lunch theft prompts ransom note from sandwich thief.""

When those news organizations did try to credit the pictures, they generally cited the Facebook page of a New Zealand radio station, which—as most non-journalists could probably tell you—isn't a real source.

But probably the funniest write-up of all came from Rupert Murdoch's News.com.au. ""Beware the sandwich thief,"" cautioned the News Corp subsidiary, apparently unable to heed their own warning."
79,"DEVELOPING: An Internet video purports to show the beheading of US reporter Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State extremist group.

The global terror intelligence firm SITE first reported the release of the video, titled ""A Second Message to America,"" in which Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist, speaks to the camera before a cloaked Islamic State fighter decapitates him.

“I’m sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing,” Sotloff said. ""Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life?”

The video then cuts to the masked militant warning that as long as U.S. missiles “continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.” He also threatens the life of British captive David Cawthorne Haines.

The grim video comes just days after Sotloff's mother, Shirley, directly addressed the leader of the Islamic State last week, saying her son shouldn't pay for U.S. government actions in the Middle East and that he cared about the weak and oppressed as a journalist.

""I want what every mother wants, to live to see her children's children,"" she said last week. ""I plead with you to grant me this.""

Shirley Sotloff cited by name the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has described himself as a caliph intending to lead the Muslim world. She had asked him to show mercy and follow the example of the prophet Muhammad in protecting people of Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths.

Sotloff was last seen in August 2013 in Syria. He was recently threatened with death by the militants on a video unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the group in Iraq. The same video showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley, 45.

Several U.S. officials, including U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., have said they were working behind the scenes to find out more about Sotloff and try to secure his release.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest could not confirm the reports when asked about the video at Tuesday’s press briefing. He noted the administration has been monitoring his situation carefully since threats were first made.

“The United States, as you know, has dedicated significant time and resources to try and rescue Mr. Sotloff,” he said, adding “thoughts and prayers” are with the family.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the intelligence community will work “as quickly as possible” to determine the video’s authenticity.

""If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act taking the life of another innocent American citizen,” she told reporters.

Pressed by Fox News, Psaki would not say whether this would constitute an act of war. She said the prior execution of journalist James Foley was a “horrific terrorist act,” and was a “motivating” factor for creating a coalition to address the Islamic State.

90,"The world was outraged yesterday when RadarOnline.com confirmed that Joan Rivers doctor Gwen Korovin took a selfie in the operating room just moments before Rivers stopped breathing on the table. Now, only RadarOnline.com has all the details of the sick shot — and why investigators are now cracking down on the shady doc after Rivers’ tragic death.

Staff from Yorkville Endoscopy, the clinic where Rivers was treated, told medical investigators looking into the death of the 81-year-old that “Dr. Korovin took the selfie with her personal cell phone,” an insider tells Radar.

What’s more, an unconscious Rivers “was in the shot,” the source reveals. “She was under anesthesia at this point. Everyone in the operating room was just stunned as they had never witnessed anyone do that before.”

PHOTOS: Celebrities Who Died In Bizarre Circumstances

It was only a few minutes later that Dr. Korovin performed the unauthorized biopsy ​that preceded Rivers’ death.

“Joan never consented to the procedure,” the source says. “And Dr. Korovin never should have been in the operating room to begin with — certainly not to perform any procedure on Joan, since she didn’t have privileges to do so at the clinic.”

Medical investigators are now “eager to talk to Dr. Korovin about the events leading up to and after Joan’s death,” the source claims. “They will certainly be asking what the purpose of taking the selfie was for, and they will want to see it.”

Meanwhile, “Joan’s daughter Melissa has been telling friends that she is a spineless monster,” the source said.

Under the care of Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who performed the endoscopy on Rivers, and her E.N.T. Specialist Korovin, Rivers stopped breathing and later died.

Dr. Cohen, who doubled as the clinic’s medical director, has since parted ways with Yorkville. The clinic confirmed his departure, stating, Dr. Cohen “is not currently performing procedures…nor is he currently serving as medical director.”

The source added, “Melissa just can’t believe a doctor would be so cavalier, especially someone with Dr. Korovin’s credentials. Joan was completely vulnerable while under anesthesia, and for her privacy to be violated like that just makes Melissa sick.”"
92,"An unfortunate woman in South Korea was left in ‘agony’ after being partially eaten by a robot vacuum cleaner.

The Guardian reports that the woman was sleeping on the floor while the autonomous roving vacuum did its job.

But disaster struck when her hair became trapped in the mechanism after the machine mistook it for dust.

Fortunately the 52-year-old woman from Changing City was able to get help in time.

The woman was immediately woken by the pain, and called the local fire department with what the Yonhap news agency reported as a “desperate rescue plea”.

She was eventually separated from the machine by paramedics and was not seriously injured. Reports say she lost ""about 10 strands"" of hair.

South Korean newspaper Kyunghyang Shinmun did not report on the specific brand of vacuum involved - though another local news source said that since sleeping on the floor is more common in the country, people may be at more risk from robotic disaster.

Inevitably thoughts here will turn to the inevitable automaton uprising - but since the other other violence known to have involved a robot vacuum is one act of suicide, we probably don't have too much to worry about."

Mittens, a stray brought in by Clarke-Murphy's daughter, would need to be spayed and neutered and then assigned a gender. Taking the advice of her veterinarian, Clarke-Murphy will make Mittens male. The assignment will help Mittens with bowel and urinary problems he previously had.

Gender reassignment surgery to help out with blocked urethras in cats is more common than you might think. More and more veterinarians are using it as a way to alleviate these kinds of problems by reassigning male cats to female. However, it's still rare to have a hermaphrodite cat. I guess it works out that Mittens is such a gender-neutral cat name."

While speaking at an Apple Store in Berlin last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees the new wearable will launch in Germany during April, according to 9to5Mac.

In January, Tim Cook said the Apple Watch would be shipping in April, but it was unclear which countries would be included in the initial launch. Cook’s statement suggests a wider initial roll-out than we’ve seen before for new product categories from the company.

It’s possible the Apple Watch will launch in the US first with other countries coming later in the month. In any case, it seems Apple fans outside the US won’t have long to wait before they can get their hands on the wearable.

Apple has its next event set for March 9, so we’ll likely find out all the launch details then."

Argentina's President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner just took on Iair Tawil as a godson. True.
Thing is, Iair is a 21-year-old son of a rabbi, and now, Argentina's first Jewish presidential godson, even though he's not a baby and is at no risk of becoming a lycanthrope.
Apparently several news agencies, which we won't be making fun of for reporting something so ridiculous, claimed that the president adopted a baby to keep it from becoming a werewolf.
In Argentina, the legend of the lobizón is similar to the standard werewolf legend. Basically, in the Argentinian legend, the seventh son of a seventh son was suuuuuper susceptible to becoming a werewolf.
What's funny is this apparently has nothing to do with the Argentinian tradition of the seventh son (or daughter) of a family being eligible to become the President's godchild. That tradition was apparently brought over by Russian immigrants in 1907.
President Fernández is already godmother to around 700 children after taking office in 2007.
Regardless, it's still pretty cute this 21-year-old man became her godson!
We love they're all lighting a menorah too, seeing as how only Christian babies used to be eligible to become presidential godchildren!
We're glad times are changing! And REALLY glad werewolves don't exist. LOLz!"
101,"Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced on Dec. 23 that she had adopted a young Jewish man as her godson to prevent him from turning into a werewolf-like creature.

According to Argentine folklore, the seventh son of a family will turn into a werewolf-like creature called “el lobizón” when he turns 13. The lobizón feeds on excrement and unbaptized babies.

The Argentine president will now become the official godparent of any family that has seven sons or daughters. The tradition dates back to 1907. In 1973, the Argentine government extended it to baby girls.

Mágico fue recibir a Iair Tawil, 1er ahijado presidencial de nuestra historia que profesa la fe judía.

Yair Tawil, Kirchner’s newest godson, is the first Jewish person to be adopted, however. Kirchner said the tradition only included Catholics until 2009.

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad…

The ceremony began in 1907 in an effort to demystify the folklore and prevent the abuse of children, but has since become a time-honored tradition. The anti-lobizón adoption ceremony also includes a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas…

The boy’s parents, Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, had written the president’s office requesting the adoption in 1993, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported.

Y a Iair, que hiciera el rezo. Un momento muy especial. Después me dijeron que tenía que apagarlas y pedir un deseo…"
103,"Turns out Bilbo might be a bad influence.

This discipline measure may not have been made with Gandalf-level wisdom.

According to the New York Daily News, a nine-year-old boy in Texas was suspended from school for telling a classmate that he could make him vanish using J.R.R. Tolkien-inspired sorcery.

Fourth grader Aiden Steward last week apparently told his friend that he could make him invisible like Bilbo Baggins by placing the ring on his head … and Kermit Elementary School officials deemed it a “terroristic threat,” reports Odessa American.

Steward’s father, though, just says it was harmless fun, inspired by their family viewing of “The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies” days prior.

“I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence,” Jason Stweard wrote in an email. “If he did, I’m sure he’d bring him right back.”

Steward told the New York Daily News that his son “didn’t mean anything by it.” The school principal refused to comment on the story, citing student confidentiality.

It kinda sounds like this kid hasn’t been getting a fair shake recently. According to the Daily News, Aiden was previously suspended for bringing “The Big Book Of Knowledge” to school because it contains an illustration of a pregnant woman."

Iga Jasica, 19, was undergoing surgery to remove a cancerous growth from inside her head at the Central Clinical Hospital in the city of Katowice in southwest Poland when the incident happened.

Neurosurgeons had removed the top part of her skull and were in the process of taking out parts of the growth when suddenly she woke up.

Iga Jasica, 19, was undergoing brain surgery in a hospital in Katowice, southwest Poland, when she suddenly came round and began speaking

But instead of panicking or crying out in pain, Miss Jasica began calmly talking to doctors and asked how her operation was going.

Medics say she was unable to see or feel anything that was happening to her, but for some reason had regained consciousness and the ability to speak.

Doctors say it is possible that the brain surgery caused neurons to trigger which could have woken Miss Jesica up, but investigators are probing whether the anesthetic was administered incorrectly.

Despite having part of her skull removed and her brain exposed, Miss Jasica began talking to doctors about how her operation was going, and cats - her favourite animal

Medics added that it was extremely unusual for a patient to come round during surgery, especially while their brain was exposed.

After the operation Miss Jasica said: 'I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love.

She was 'rejected by 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes'

It took her two years to find willing surgeon who would also add a nipple

She now has a film crew tracking her 'struggles as a three-breasted woman'

A 21-year-old woman claims to have paid $20,000 to surgically add a third breast in a desperate bid to become a reality TV star.

Jasmine Tridevil, not her real name, insists she was rejected by more than 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes before she found a willing surgeon who would perform the procedure.

Now, she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, Florida, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman.

Three-breasted? Jasmine Tridevil, 21, claims she paid $20,000 to have a third breast surgically attached to her chest. She is now filming her own reality show about the struggles she faces as a three-breasted woman

Surgeons are reluctant to perform unnatural procedures as the ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.'

Tridevil claims she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the operation on the grounds that she kept their name a secret.

The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate.

And she has proudly declared that she been disowned by her mother and sister, who ran out the room in disgust when they saw what she had done.

'My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me,' Tridevil said.

Dreams of being a star: The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida, said her dream is to have a show on MTV

'My dad… he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.'

However, Tridevil insists she has no regrets as she prepares to send pilot episodes of her self-produced reality show titled Jasmine's Jugs to MTV.

'My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,' she told Real Radio 104.1.

'I'm dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn't work, I'm through.'

Despite scheduling interviews, creating a fan page, and hiring a film crew, Tridevil insists her apparent surgery was not an attempt become famous.

Reminiscent: Her new look is similar to that of the three-breasted prostitute in the 1990 film Total Recall

Disowned: Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says she has been disowned by her mother

'I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,' she claims. 'Because I don't want to date anymore.'

The new look is reminiscent of the alluring three-breasted prostitute who parades around semi-topless in the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

The bizarre character prompted one of the most famous movie quotes to date, as a man declares: 'Baby, you make me wish I had three hands!'"
127,"Michael Jackson, legendary as he was as the King of Pop, wasn’t the most the popular dad in showbiz. Ever since the Berlin baby-dangling incident of ’02, the media has tirelessly and unfairly portrayed him as an irresponsible and detached father (before his death, Jackson had shown remorse for the incident). This depiction was unfortunately fueled by his own erratic behavior during the final years of his life, and the sexual abuse charges that chased Jackson a few years before his death certainly didn’t help with his image.

This week, social media went crazy over a “news” article that had been circulating Facebook and Twitter like wildfire. An article published by Empire News entitled, “DNA Results Confirm Michael Jackson Is Biological Father Of Bruno Mars,” has unsurprisingly shocked and enraged fans of both singers across the internet.

The story went on to detail how the Billionaire singer allegedly and inadvertently revealed where he got his singing genes. The article wrote that the discovery involved Mars’ firing of a certain Vladimir Kershov, the singer’s reported publicist.

“Vladimir Kershov, publicist of R&B singer Bruno Mars, has been fired today after he revealed a shocking secret regarding the pop and R&B singer. Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars’ biological father.”

Gullible netizens went insane over the Michael Jackson-Bruno Mars story, not realizing that Empire News, an Onion-like website (without the funny), publishes mostly “satirical” and made-up articles. Fact-checking website Snopes has since labelled the story “false”.

According to Bruno’s Wikipedia page, the half-Filipino singer was born to Peter Hernandez and Bernadette Bayot in 1985 and was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. Meanwhile, Michael was, at the time, not involved with anyone, although he was already beginning to form a relationship with future-wife Lisa Marie Presley.

While Jackson was often portrayed as a bad dad in tabloids, he was, in reality, an amazing father to his kids Michael Jr, Paris and Prince. Shortly after his death, MTV revealed never-before seen correspondence with people closest to Michael, most of whom attested to the fact that the singer was a caring and loving dad to his children. Producer and Jackson’s friend Teddy Reily recalled, “Michael] read them a book every day. When we were in Virginia during the Invincible [sessions], there was not one day missed reading the children something. So that showed me right there that he was an incredible father.”

In other news, Michael Jackson’s brothers continue to celebrate his musical legacy through various performances around the world. Inquisitr recently reported about the brothers’ upcoming UAE concert, which is set to be attended by thousands of fans.

128,"UPDATE: Sod Crabzilla, Now Budapest Is Under Attack From A Furious Giant

Behold – there is a ocean-dwelling beast lurking off the shore of Whitstable.

Yes, the sleepy seaside town famed for its oysters and cream teas is now apparently home to a giant sea monster, which has rightly earned the moniker ‘Crabzilla’.

A satellite image of the colossal crustacean – thought to be 50ft across - surfaced on Weird Whitstable, an online journal dedicated to tall tales in the area.

Could it be...?

Blog curator Quinton Winter revealed to The Express he had encountered the decapod himself: “At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sandbank. Now I know better.”

Winter first made reference to the giant crab in July last year when he published a wholly unconvincing image of an oversized shellfish poking its claws out of the water below two blissfully unaware children playing on the pier.

It was accompanied with the explanation: “This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend.

“The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passerbys shouted to them, the crab silently slipped away under the water, into the dark, sideways.”

According to the Marine Biological Association of the UK, the biggest crab in the world is the Japanese Spider Crab, which can grow up to 3.7m across.

Crabzilla, however appears to be shaped like an edible crab, commonly found in British waters and growing up to 5 inches in width.

Graphic artist Ashley Austen told Kent Online: “The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop.

“All the ‘artist’ had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it onto the satellite picture of the harbour and apply a few filters to get the realistic look.”

133,"An Indian bride has married a guest at her wedding after her groom-to-be had a seizure and collapsed.

Reports said the groom, Jugal Kishore, was epileptic and he had kept the information from the bride, Indira, and her family.

While Mr Kishore was taken to hospital, the angry bride decided to switch husbands.

She asked a member of her brother-in-law's family, who was a guest, to step in and marry her instead. He agreed.

The incident took place in Rampur town in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.

According to a report in The Times of India, Mr Kishore, 25, fell to the ground in front of the wedding guests just as he was reaching out to garland Indira.

On his return from the hospital, Mr Kishore pleaded with Indira to change her mind, telling her that he would be ridiculed by friends and relatives if he went home without a bride, but she refused.

Local police official Ram Khiladi Solanki told the BBC that Mr Kishore and his family were initially upset and lodged a complaint with the police.

""But since the bride is already married now, what can anyone do? So the families have resolved the matter and the complaint has been withdrawn,"" he added."

Just in case you needed more nightmare fuel... ((AP Photos/California Department of Corrections)
Just in case you needed more nightmare fuel… ((AP Photos/California Department of Corrections)
The New York Post is reporting that journalist Daniel Simone learned the true reason behind the nixed nuptials: Manson’s fiancee was marrying him to get access to his corpse.

According to Simone, Star isn’t quite the deranged Manson maniac we all thought she was. She was a woman with a plan. Not a good plan, necessarily. But a plan.

When Manson keeled over, Star reportedly envisioned putting the murderous cult leader on display Lenin-style in a glass coffin so she could charge money to morbid looky-loos.



Manson was allegedly less-than-pleased with this idea and called off the unholy prison wedding — potentially the only good thing he’s ever done his life. The Post has all the details, including this masterpiece of insanity:

Another reason the madman balked at the plan is because he believes he is immortal. “He feels he will never die,” Simone said. “Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.”

Manson is housed in California State Prison, Corcoran and is presumably now looking for a life partner who is not interested in profiting off his disgusting corpse. Please send all applications straight to an incinerator and seek professional help immediately."
141,"Hewlett Packard plans to split into two companies on Monday, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. One company will be focused on enterprise computing and services, and the other will build and sell PCs and printers.

Current HP CEO Meg Whitman will lead the enterprise-focused version of HP (it’s not clear who gets to keep the iconic name) and will be chairman of the PC/printer company, which will be led by Dion Weisler as CEO. Details are still fuzzy as to how this will all work, but WSJ reported that HP plans to announce the move on Monday.

HP is perhaps the seminal Silicon Valley company, with a rich history of computing breakthroughs and technology leadership since it was founded in 1939. But despite taking in $112 billion in revenue in 2013 (split almost evenly between the groups that will form the two separate companies) it has struggled over the last decade with the decline of the PC market, the rise of mobile computing, and the shift to enterprise cloud computing. A series of at-times comical leadership fiascos hasn’t helped.

I’ll update this post as more information becomes available, and we’ll certainly cover any announcement HP might make tomorrow."

163,"In a day packed with major Apple announcements, the company tackled smartphones, wearables, and payments. But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment: Social.

According to a single well-placed source inside Apple’s engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morin’s Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, “It’s almost done, if not signed already, but it’s essentially a done deal.”

If true, it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers – particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasn’t fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color.

According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apple’s newly refreshed Messages app. That doesn’t mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebook’s $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.

Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to command anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, Path ranks just 177th among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead.

Apple’s re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, it’s unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Apple’s one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held love of more lasting, intimate communications. It’s certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple’s messaging platform, but it’s unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price.

Adding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for today’s Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders.

Did not forget about Dre. pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYr — Dave Morin (@davemorin) September 9, 2014

Apple has been known to be a fan of Morin’s, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the company’s decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldn’t be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. Jason Calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morin’s seating at today’s event and Apple’s long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years.

To be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactions are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It’s certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didn’t have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin’s vaunted reputation for design, and Apple’s social struggles I can’t think of a better home for the once-hyped app. Don’t be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status.

Pando has reached out to Morin for confirmation (or otherwise) of the claim. We will update this post as soon as I hear back."
165,"A FIVE-YEAR-OLD boy has been billed with a ""no show fee"" - for missing his friend's BIRTHDAY party.

Derek Nash and his partner discovered the invoice - for the sum of £15.95 - after it was slipped into their son Alex's school bag.

The host of the party gave it to Alex via a teacher after he failed to show up for the get-together at a ski slope and snowboard centre in Plymouth, Cornwall.

Alex's family confirmed that their son would be attending the party just before the Christmas holidays.

But Mr Nash, from Torpoint, Cornwall, realised he had arranged for their daughter to go on a day trip with her grandparents.

He then asked Alex if he wished to join his sister or go to the party, to which he chose to spend time with his grandparents.

Bemused Mr Nash said he originally thought the invoice ""was a joke"", but the issue has remained unresolved and now the birthday boy's mother has threatened to take him to a small claims court.

He said: ""She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.""

However, after Alex had changed his mind about the party, Ms Nash realised he had no way of contacting the birthday boy's mother.

""So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do - he chose to be with his grandparents,"" he said.

""By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy's mother] know.""

Alex returned to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School on January 6, but just over a week later, the family were stunned to receive the bill.

Mr Nash continued: ""My partner looked out for [the friend's mother] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn't see her.

""But on January 15 she looked in Alex's school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for 15.95 for a child's party no show fee.

""I asked Alex's class teacher if [the child's mother] had given anything to her. She said, 'Yes, a brown envelope'.

""I then visited Alex's school headteacher, who couldn't apologise enough that one of the teachers had passed this on.

""She said she would remind all staff that this was a breach of protocol.""

He then went to visit the mother, since named as Julie Lawrence and whose address was on the invoice, and told her that he would not be paying the bill.

""I told her she should have spoken to me first and not put the invoice in my son's school bag,"" he said.

""I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up, but I just can't believe the way she has gone around it.""

The mother has since threatened the family to take the case to a small claims court, while the birthday boy will no longer play with Alex at school.

Mr Nash added: ""I drive all around the South West for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this.

""They're all quite incredulous that this has happened. I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words.""

His partner, who does not want to be named, has been in contact with the mum on Facebook and is hoping to resolve the situation.

In a short statement, Ms Lawrence said she had no regrets about sending the invoice.

She said: ""All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me.""

Manager of the Plymouth ski and snowboard centre, Louisa Duggan, said they would never send invoices to individuals and were upset at being dragged into the row.

She said: ""This is nothing to do with us. It is a dispute between two parents. But I really need to clarify that we don't send invoices to private individuals - ever.

""We don't know the names of the children coming so we would never even be able to.

""We are upset that we have been dragged into this. We ask families who book with us to pay a small deposit and then 48 hours before we ask them to confirm the numbers.

""This gives them plenty of time to get responses in. We are quite flexible if any of the party does not turn up.

""We can put on other activities to compensate or often an adult will take part in place.

""We do need to know how many people are coming because we have to plan food and reserve activities and spaces. That is how any businesses like ours has to operate."""

The bird, nicknamed the Black Widow, left her suitor half-eaten, shocking vets at the animal shelter in Knyszynska Forest. Park keepers had noticed the owl was unhappy and decided to pair her up with a new mate. But just two days after arriving from Germany, they found the new owl devoured and dead. Shelter spokesman, Robert Konowal, said: ""The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well. ""We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him. ""At first we couldn’t understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped.

The zoo confirmed that they were now looking for another snowy owl to be provided but said so far other facilities were reluctant to accommodate the request after the way the owl's last partner ended up.
Konowal added: ""She may be a bit fussy but we're sure there's another owl out there who will meet her standards."""

A couple of weeks back the Apple Watch was formally unveiled but the company also revealed that it won’t hit the market until early 2015. There has already been much speculation about why Apple missed its 2014 launch target for this wearable device but what most people are now interested is when it’ll finally be available? If recent reports are to be believed then Valentine’s Day 2015 may be the Apple Watch release target.
Every year Apple releases its new iPhones and iPads around the holiday season which is one of the most lucrative shopping seasons of the year. Probably why it was assumed from the very start that Apple’s smartwatch too would be released around the same time.
But recently rumors about production issues starting cropping up, hinting that the release may have been pushed back as a result of these delays. While Apple hasn’t confirmed if production issues really did play a part in pushing the smartwatch’s release into 2015 CEO Tim Cook did remark in an interview with Bloomberg BusinessWeek that Apple “could have done the watch much earlier, honestly, but not at the fit and finish and quality and integration of these products.”
Valentine’s Day doesn’t see shopping frenzy that can rival the lucrative holiday season but its still that time of the year when people are a bit loose with their wallets. The Information reports on the possibility of Apple shipping the smartwatch by Valentine’s Day 2015 and 9to5mac has been hearing whispers about the same, still there no confirmation on this from Cupertino.
Whenever the Apple Watch ultimately go on sale it will start from $349."

It read in full: 'Dear Mr R

'Even though you're gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now.

'I still think about you the same way as I used to.

'You're a great teacher and these are just some of the words that I would describe you as: great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.

'The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave.

'You don't have to feel scared because I know that everyone in the class feels the same way as I do.

'From A x x

'PS. We are all proud of you'

The teacher then shared the letter on social media.

He told PinkNews: 'As a primary school teacher, I'd always worried about mentioning my sexuality, despite the fact that my colleagues talked about their husbands, wives and significant others all the time.

'Then, as part of anti-bullying week, I'd asked who'd heard 'gay' being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned.'

The teacher, who preferred to stay anonymous, said that he welled up after reading the letter (picture posed by models)

He continued: 'Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.

'After speaking to my Head, who was very supportive, we agreed I could tell the class that I'm gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they're talking about me.'

'The reaction was fantastic – there were a lot of gasps and shocked looks and some basic questions – do you have a boyfriend, etc – but after a couple of minutes they were over it and we moved on to the rest of the lesson.

'The letter came a couple of days later. The little girl who wrote it gave it to me at the start of the day with all the other slips about dinner money, school trips and doctors appointments.

'Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson, 'It's just your life'. Then she went back to her maths.

'For my class it was a surprise sure but, to them, it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgement, no follow-up, just acceptance.

'Now, I can mention my fiance as easily as any other teacher and my class know me a little better. I've had a lot of letters and cards over the years, but this one I know I'll keep forever.'"

211,"Update at 5:38 p.m.

Did Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner take on a godson? Yes. Did she do it, as we and others reported, because of the legend of the werewolf? No.

The Guardian reports that a tradition that began during mass Russian immigration to Argentina in the early 20th century became conflated with a local legend involving seventh sons and werewolves.

""The local myth of the [lobison] is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son [or seventh daughter] born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,"" Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told the newspaper.

The emigres from Russia who asked the Argentine president in 1907 to become the godfather to their seventh son were carrying on a custom from czarist Russia. The practice became law in 1974.

Our original post is below:

Silver bullets are believed to be among the few effective weapons against werewolves. In Argentina, add presidential protection to that short list.

President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, in keeping with a long-standing tradition, has embraced a 21-year-old Jewish man as her godson to prevent him from assuming a lycanthropic form.

The root of the story is the mythology of the Guarani people that says the seventh son in a family of only male children will turn into el lobison — a werewolf. This legend prompted some people to abandon — or kill — their seventh-born sons. So Argentina passed a law in the 1920s that gave the seventh son presidential protection along with a gold medal and a scholarship until his 21st birthday.

At first, that law covered only Catholic families. But in 2009, a presidential decree broadened the law to cover children of other faiths, too.

Kirchner's godson is Yair Tawil, the seventh son of a rabbi, and he's the first Jewish godson of an Argentine president.

The Jewish Telegraphic Agency reports:

Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office in Buenos Aires. They lit Hanukkah candles on a menorah the family presented her. Kirchner publicized the event on Twitter, calling the meeting ""magical"" and the Tawil family ""marvelous."""

A staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia, the source said.

Rivers, 81, was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor, gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen. That procedure, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.

After Cohen, the clinic's medical director, finished his work, a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent, according to the source.

An ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician.

""Even though you are a licensed physician, you still should have, if you will, the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place,"" said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center.

Investigators believe that Rivers' vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said.

Rivers, 81, was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she died a week later.

Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released.

The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Dr. Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures...nor is he currently serving as medical director.""

The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators.

The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law."

The national airline of Saudi Arabia could be set to segregate sexes on board its flights amid claims men have lodged complaints about male strangers sitting next to their wives.

The airline carrier already complies with strict Islam practices including not serving alcohol or pork products, providing a men's prayer area on most international flights and not employing Saudi women as cabin crew.

But the airline does employ women of other nationalities.

248,"(CNN) -- The mother of James Foley -- an American journalist beheaded by ISIS militants -- said she is ""embarrassed and appalled"" by how the U.S. government dealt with her son's case, telling CNN that officials even suggested family members could be charged if they raised ransom to free him.

""I think our efforts to get Jim freed were an annoyance"" to the U.S. government, Diane Foley told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an interview that aired Thursday. ""It didn't seem to be in (U.S.) strategic interest, if you will.""

Officials told Foley family members ""not go to the media,"" and that the ""government would not exchange prisoners,"" or carry out ""military action"" to try to rescue her son, according to Diane Foley.

""Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,"" Diane Foley said. ""As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.""

She added that the family was told many times that raising ransom ""was illegal (and) we might be prosecuted.""

""We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,"" Foley's mother told CNN. ""And he wasn't, was he?""

In fact, video posted online on August 19 showed James Foley kneeling next to a man dressed in black, with Foley reading a presumably scripted message that his ""real killer"" is America, then being summarily executed.

ISIS -- the Islamist extremist group that's taken over large swaths of Syria and Iraq in its quest to create a far-reaching caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law -- took credit for Foley's beheading, saying it was in response to U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and threatening more killings.

'Our government needs to be ... willing to negotiate'

More than three weeks later, U.S. President Barack Obama named Foley as he outlined his strategy for fighting ISIS and described the terrorist group's brutality.

""They enslave, rape, and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. In acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists -- Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff,"" Obama said in a televised address Wednesday night.

As she watched the speech, Diane Foley said one thing was going through her mind.

""This whole strategy to eliminate ISIS and the terror threat is important, obviously, so perhaps part of the strategic way of doing that is to bomb them, and to engage in force. But that only caused Jim's death,"" she said. ""I guess all I'm trying to say is that our government needs to be shrewder, smarter, willing to negotiate with these people who hate us, so that we can find better ways to rid ourselves of terror.""

'He was compelled to bear witness'

After her son's death, Diane Foley wrote on the Free James Foley Facebook page that ""we have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.""

Sometimes, she said Thursday, it was tough for his family to deal with his decisions to report in dangerous parts of the world.

""At times, even his siblings were angered that he would return after his captivity in Libya. I mean, it was hard as a family to understand, because Jim was so loved ... and we were selfish. We wanted him with us. We wanted him safe,"" she said. ""But Jim was not. Jim was selfless, and he had the courage and the compassion. ... He was compelled to bear witness.""

To this end, his family launched a foundation -- the James W. Foley Legacy Fund -- aimed at helping families of American hostages, supporting U.S. journalists in war zones and helping urban youth in educational endeavors.

The organization is one way the Foley family is trying to honor James' past and do something positive in the future. But none of it takes away Diane Foley's disappointment that more wasn't done -- especially by the U.S. government -- to secure his release, somehow, since his November 22, 2012, disappearance in northwest Syria. At the time he was working for U.S.-based online news outlet GlobalPost.

""Jim would have been saddened"" by the U.S. government's efforts in the years after his abduction, his mother told CNN. ""Jim believed, till the end, that his country would come to (his) aid.""

A failed rescue operation

Upon hearing these comments, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice -- after praising the Foley family for doing ""an amazing job ... to try to bring Jim home safely"" -- said she ""and others in the U.S. government worked very hard with Diane Foley and her family to try to be supportive, to try to provide what information we could.""

Rice also pointed out ""hundreds of American personnel"" were involved in a ""very daring and very well-executed rescue operation"" to free Foley and other captives, after getting what they hoped was ""actionable intelligence"" about the location of the hostages. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby has said elite U.S. commandos undertook this mission this summer inside Syria.

Official: U.S. commandos tried, failed to rescue hostages

""Unfortunately, they were no longer there,"" Rice, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN. ""But I think that effort ... underscores the importance that we attach to doing everything that we possibly can to bring Americans in captivity back home.""

Diane Foley, though, said the rescue operation came ""very late.""

""Their location was known for more than a year,"" she said.

During her son's time in captivity, she said, it often seemed the family knew more about his whereabouts than the authorities.

""I did all I could,"" she said. ""I was unable to do enough.""

Lessons for the future

Now, Diane Foley says she thinks Washington should change its approach to cases like that of her son and Steven Sotloff, another American journalist beheaded by ISIS weeks after James Foley.

""I pray that our government will be willing to learn from the mistakes that were made,"" she told CNN, ""and to acknowledge that there are better ways for American citizens to be treated.""

There should be international dialogue about how to handle hostages of terrorist groups, she said.

""The risk is becoming higher and higher,"" she said, ""and I really feel that our country let Jim down.""

249,"Amid conflicting reports, an Islamic State (Isis) spokesperson has confirmed the militant group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been injured in a recent US air strike.

The US has not yet confirmed whether al-Baghdadi was among the wounded in the attack, but Iraqi security officials have been quoted as saying he was injured.

Nonetheless, Abu Mohammed Al-Adnani, an official spokesperson for the Sunni insurgent group, wrote on Twitter: ""The leader of the ISIL [IS] Abu Bakr al-Baghdad has been injured.

""Do you think the State of Khilafa will end by the death of the Caliphate? We assure for the State that the Amir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is fine and we ask his followers to pray for God for his safety.""

Some have questioned the credibility of the Twitter account.

The US air strike which took place in the IS-controlled city of Mosul was targeted at top leaders of the extremist organisation. Local officials in Mosul said more than 50 bodies were brought to a morgue following the US aerial bombardment.

""This strike demonstrates the pressure we continue to place on the ISIL [IS] terrorist network and the group's increasingly limited freedom to manoeuvre, communicate and command,"" the US Central Command said.

The Iraqi State television reported that al-Baghdadi's top aide was also killed in the air strike but it could not be independently verified.

There were rumours earlier regarding al-Baghdadi's injury or death, however these turned out to be false.

Iga Jasica, of Poland, was having a cancerous growth removed from her brain at the Central Clinical Hospital in the city of Katowice when, mid-surgery, the anesthetic wore off, mirror.co.uk reported.

Jasica, whose brain was exposed at the time she awoke, asked the docs how the surgery was going — then started chatting about cats.

“Despite coming round, she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger,” neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz said.

It’s possible the surgery may have triggered something that woke her up, experts said — but doctors are also looking into whether the anesthesia was administered correctly.

Jasica later said: “I can’t remember much, but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation, but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great.”"

Helric Fredou, 45, shot himself with his police-issued gun after meeting relatives of one of the 12 victims of the terror attack at the magazine's Paris office, according to reports.

Mr Fredou was Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges, south of the French capital, and is believed to have been one of the leading figures in the investigation into the attack.


French media reported that the single police officer, who had no children, had complained of being ""depressed” and overworked before the massacre.

His body is thought to have been discovered in his office at Limoges by a colleague at around 1am on Thursday morning.

275,"An angry aunt is facing jail time in China, after she was interrupted on the toilet by her three-year-old nephew, and proceeded to slice off his penis in anger.

Xue Paan, 37, reportedly attacked her nephew, Qiang Qiang in a rage, while she babysat him as his mother, her sister, went to visit neighbors nearby.

According to reports, Paan was sitting on the toilet sending text messages to her boyfriend when the bored toddler burst into the bathroom and asked if he could play games on her smart phone.

The question from the youngster apparently sent Paan into such a rage that she went to the kitchen, grabbed a blunt knife and severed the screaming child’s penis completely.

Having attacked her helpless nephew, Paan reportedly fled the scene as Qiang’s mother heard her son’s screams and rushed to the apartment, “I had popped out to see a neighbour and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream.”

The child had apparently fainted from the pain and shock of the ordeal, and was laying a pool of his own blood when his mother arrived, a knife was next to his severed penis.

Qiang’s mother said, “I ran back to the house and couldn’t believe what I saw.”

Qiang Qiang was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach his penis, he and was then sent to a specialist clinic in the capital Beijing.

A spokesperson for the hospital told reporters.

“Unfortunately, the knife was quite blunt and the cut wasn’t clean so although we reattached the boy’s penis, it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment. However, he has now had three surgeries all of which have been successful and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.”

Fortunately, the police caught up with the angry aunt, saying, ‘The aunt was arrested and admitted attacking the boy because she was angry that he had interrupted her on the toilet.” She now faces up to five years in jail for the attack."

Girl destroys boyfriends penis in acid attack after video of them having sex goes viral Girl destroys boyfriends penis in acid attack after video of them having sex goes viral

""I never intended to kill his penis. I was just angry and all I wanted was to make him feel the pain I was feeling,"" she told a Sapa correspondent.

""I heard about the video from one of my classmates and I thought that they were joking, but then I saw the video myself and lost my mind.""

The girl, whose name is known to a Sapa correspondent but cannot be published because she is a minor, attacked Humphrey Khoza, 25, with battery acid while he was drinking beer with friends at a tavern in Cork village, near Hazyview, on January 17.

She said Khoza had tricked her because she was not aware he was not using a condom or that he was filming them.

""I had to do something to show him that I was angry and wanted to hurt him so that he can see that he messed with the wrong girl,"" she said.

She searched in her father's tools for a wheel spanner she could use to teach Khoza a lesson.

""While I was searching I came across an old acid bottle. I took it and went straight to his regular drinking place and when I got there I became angrier. I didn't hesitate to pour the acid on him,"" she said.

Khoza, who had no problem with his name being published, but asked not to be photographed, said he had been dating the girl since December.

""Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle, but I didn't realise that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog,"" he said.

""She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex.""

In the video, Khoza is seen pushing the girl, in her school uniform, onto a bed. He added that the sex was consensual.

""We agreed to have sex, but she was not aware that I was filming the sex using my laptop computer. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still don't know how it got onto social media,"" he said.

The remorseful Khoza added that although his penis would never work again due to the damage caused by the acid, he was lucky to be alive.

He said he was advised to press charges against the girl, but does not see the point.

""Even if I press charges it is useless because it won't bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts,"" said Khoza.

He now has to urinate through a tube and has to undergo surgery.

The girl said she was also considering pressing charges relating to his creation of pornography.

According to the Film and Publications Act, child pornography is defined as ""any image or any description of a person, real or simulated, who is, or who is depicted or described as being, under the age of 18 years, engaged in sexual conduct"".

279,"Charles Manson’s fiancee allegedly had a morbid plan for his body after he died. Given the recent turn of events, his engagement to Afton Elaine Burton, also known as “Star,” is off.

Journalist Daniel Simone spoke with the NY Post about the 27-year-old’s plan to marry one of the most infamous killers in history. Burton reportedly hadn’t planned to marry Manson for love, but for profit. She and a friend by the name of Craig Hammond wanted to rake in money by putting Manson’s corpse in a glass crypt. As Simone says, it was a “California version of Lenin’s Tomb” and “would draw huge crowds and make big money.”

The 80-year-old has no interest in having his body displayed in a glass coffin. He realized what his fiancee was up to and got out. Simone adds that Charles Manson doesn’t believe he’ll ever even face death.

“He feels he will never die. Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.”

The couple’s marriage license expired on Thursday, as Inquisitr revealed. Burton and Hammond’s website claims they “plan on renewing the license, and things will move forward in the coming months.”

Simone’s writing partner for The Retrial of Charles Manson is Heidi Joran Ley. The two are looking for someone to publish their book. The authors say Star Burton and her friend allegedly came up with their plan to get Manson’s corpse about two years ago. When the pair asked Manson to sign a document that would allow them to take his body after he dies.

What Burton and Hammond may not have realized, is that Manson was playing them. Simone says Manson didn’t give them a yes or no on signing the document. Since his fiancee and Hammond would bring him “toiletries and other items,” Manson continued “stringing them along” because it “kept the goodies coming.”

Exasperated by their attempt to get Manson to sign over his dead body, a plan was devised to get Burton married to Manson since California law would grant her possession of his remains upon his death, Simone says.

The journalist surmises that Mason had no intention of marrying Star Burton.

In a separate report by Fox 2 News, Burton’s mother disputes the entire report, claiming that her daughter isn’t marrying Charles Manson to get his remains after he dies.

“She is my daughter no matter what is going on in her life. You would love her unconditionally too if she were your child.”

According to the New York Post , a fisherman in Russia was attacked by a brown bear, but was able to escape death when his Justin Bieber ringtone went off and scared the bear.

Igor Vorozhbitsyn, 42, was heading toward his favorite fishing spot in Russia’s Yakutia Republic when a bear started clawing at him, according to The Austrian Times .

The man told the news agency that his granddaughter had downloaded the hit song “Baby” onto his phone as a joke. As funny as the joke may be, it was lifesaving when his phone rang during the attack and Bieber’s melody scared the bear.

According to the report, the man said the bear halted the attack and fled back into the forest.

The man said he “couldn’t believe” his luck.

According to wildlife experts who spoke with The Austrian Times, a “sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks” as the ringtone was a “very unexpected sound for a bear”.

306,"An Egyptian man named Abu Obeida al-Masri has reportedly fled to Turkey with more than $1 million belonging to ISIS.

Obeida was secretary of the Zakat bureau and treasurer of the ISIS Syrian branch before fleeing with the money, notes the IBTimes UK. The amount he stole reportedly reached one billion Syrian pounds.

According to the Hidaya Foundation, Zakat is an obligatory act that has to be performed by every adult and able-bodied Muslim. It is an important pillar among the five pillars of Islam. Zakat is a part of the wealth and property that Muslims must pay annually, to help the poor of their community. One of the main purposes of Zakat is to keep those who are wealthy clean, monetarily, from sin. It is a form of Sadaqah (charity) which is obligatory for Muslims.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said ISIS ""has forced the merchants and industrialists to pay 2.5% of each sale.""

When the merchants told ISIS militants that they are already helping and supporting the poor families with money and aid, ISIS did not exempt them from paying the 2.5%.

""The money paid to the poor without reference to the Zakat Chamber is an act of charity, but it doesn't exempt traders from paying to the Zakat Chamber,"" they explained.

As a result of this incident, rumors claim that ISIS militants have issued an order to no longer recruit any Egyptian jihadists.

This financial blow to ISIS is not the only breaking news from the terrorist group as a recent video was released on Tuesday which showed Jordanian pilot al-Kaseasbeh being burned alive. This has sparked European and United States outrage against the terrorist group.

Jordanian officials have sworn vengeance against the Islamic State terrorist group for murdering al-Kaseasbeh. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has also issued a statement condemning the brutality and violence that ISIS has repeatedly shown against humanity.

“ISIL is trying to build this overarching caliphate through which there is no diversity of thought, of religion, values or culture,” says Gianni Pittella, member of the European Parliament. “The fact remains that ISIL is a very pernicious entity.”

In a report that aired on Fox News Channel’s “The Kelly File,” host Megyn Kelly revealed U.S. Marines stationed to guard the U.S. Embassy in Yemen were instructed by the State Department to surrender their weapons to local authorities upon the evacuation of those facilities.

“[L]ate last night, the State Department ordering all personnel in the U.S. embassy in Yemen to pack up and get out,” Kelly explained. “Last month an Iranian-backed rebel group overthrowing the U.S.-backed government — it’s a group which you can see here, is not particularly fond of the United States, as they chant “death to America.” And now they are consolidating power and the security situation for Americans is rapidly deteriorating. Now tonight a senior defense official confirming to Fox News that Marines were directed to turn over their weapons before they were allowed to leave. According to one source the order came from the U.S. State Department. That is generating some serious outrage tonight especially among Marines who are taught from day one never surrender your weapon. At least one Marine telling Fox News, ‘Blank yeah, it pissed me off.’ Pardon me, his term. ‘I’m not giving up my weapon to anyone.’”

UPDATE:

The U.S. Marine Corp denied the report in a statement released Wednesday night:

The Marine Security Force left the American embassy in Yemen for the movement to the airfield as part of the “ordered departure” with only personal weapons. All crew served weapons were destroyed at the embassy prior to movement. None of them were ‘handed over’ in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan.

Upon arrival at the airfield, all personal weapons were rendered inoperable in accordance with advance planning. Specifically, each bolt was removed from its weapons body and rendered inoperable by smashing with sledgehammers. The weapons bodies, minus the bolts, were then separately smashed with sledgehammers. All of these destroyed components were left at the airport — and components were scattered; no usable weapon was taken from any Marine at Sana’a airport.

To be clear: No Marine handed a weapon to a Houthi, or had one taken from him."

315,"A “tempting eyes” ban has just been announced in Saudi Arabia that further represses women more than they already are. In this part of the world, women are known to cover their bodies completely from head-to-toe. The eyes are one of the only parts of their body that are seen in public.

Opposing Views reports that women who have eyes “with a nice shape and makeup” could be deemed too tempting to other men, and police can make them wear veils. Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice announced this decision a few days ago. It’s one bound to get universal criticism.

Assyrian International News Agency covered what the Saudi Arabian committee’s spokesman has to say about the new law. Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, explains that Saudi police “have a right” to make a woman cover her eyes.

“The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones. We have the right to do so.”

This development has sparked the question of what defines “tempting eyes” and how will women be evaluated on having them? An unidentified journalist in the nation best describes what Saudi police are going after.

“Uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.”

He adds that a lot of people in Saudi Arabia will be very upset about the law. This type of control will outrage citizens of the country, the unnamed journalist says.

“It’s so stupid. I don’t know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won’t be silent.”

The report notes that no divide between Church and State exists in Saudi Arabia. The bad part is that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has powerful “backers” that include Prince Naif, the heir to the nation’s throne. He announced that the committee “should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.”

If there was any hope among the people that King Abdullah’s son would steer Saudi Arabia in a different direction, it’s lost at this point. By supporting the committee, the prince also supports the “tempting eye ban.” Oppression will continue in the nation, as women are considered nothing more than property.

316,"Microsoft is nearing a deal to buy Mojang AB, makers of the Minecraft video game franchise, according to a new report. According to the Wall Street Journal, the deal would value Mojang at more than $2 billion and could be signed as soon as this week.

Microsoft and Mojang declined to comment to the Journal. As the Journal notes, the move would be surprising given that Mojang founder Markkus ""Notch"" Persson, is a darling of the indie gaming scene who has avoided taking venture capital. He has also criticized Microsoft's Windows 8 for potentially being ""very, very bad for indie games.""

AN UNLIKELY TARGET FOR ACQUISITION

Minecraft, which first came out in 2009, has sold more than 50 million copies. Stockholm-based Mojang had $100 million in profits last year, according to the Journal. It's a reflection of the fact that Minecraft, an open-world game where players can build almost anything they can imagine while avoiding spiders and other dangers, has become a multi-platform global phenomenon. The Journal argues that owning Minecraft could ""invigorate"" Microsoft's Xbox business, though the game has long been available on that platform.

Mojang has been seen as an unlikely target for acquisition because its small team of about 40 people makes a highly profitable game in Minecraft and whose leader has expressed a desire to invest those profits in unusual new games. Persson has also been critical of large corporations in general; he canceled a planned version of Minecraft for Oculus Rift after the virtual reality company sold to Facebook."

A source told CNN that after Cohen completed the procedure, which involves putting a camera down the throat, Rivers' personal physician — an unidentified ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic — stepped in to perform the vocal-cord biopsy, corroborating an earlier report by the Daily News.

CNN also reported that an unnamed clinic staff member told investigators that the personal physician took a selfie in the room while Rivers was under. CNN's source also said neither the gastroenterologist nor the ear, nose and throat doctor had been accused of wrongdoing.

A procedure such as a vocal cord biopsy requires patient consent and would only be authorized to take place in a hospital setting. The clinic released a statement last week saying no such biopsy was performed on Rivers, and declined to respond to CNN's report, citing federal privacy laws.

However CNN's source said investigators are focusing on the biopsy and believe her vocal chords started swelling after the physician made a spur-of-the-moment decision to remove a growth with a scalpel. The swelling may have cut off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which could have triggered cardiac arrest, according to CNN and the Daily News.

Rivers suffered cardiac arrest on Aug. 29, and died a week later at Mount Sinai Hospital.

332,"NEW YORK (AP) — Hewlett-Packard is splitting itself into two companies, one focused on its personal computer and printing business and another on technology services, such as data storage, servers and software, as it aims to drive profits higher.

The company laid off tens of thousands of people in recent years as sales crumbled, with customers shifting to mobile devices like smartphones and computer tablets. That has drastically curbed demand for HP's desktop and laptop computers, as well as its printers.

The company said Monday that the PC and printer business will use the name HP Inc. The services business will be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File)

HP CEO Meg Whitman will lead the Enterprise business. HP PC and printer chief Dion Weisler will be CEO of HP Inc.

""The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan,"" Whitman said. ""It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics.""

The split, if approved by the company board, is expected to close by the end of fiscal 2015. Once complete, HP stockholders will own shares of both companies.

During its most recent quarter HP reported revenue of $27.6 billion, a 1 percent annual gain. It marked HP's first year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue since late 2011. Printers and computers contributed 51 percent of the company's quarterly revenue, with the rest coming from technology services like consulting, software and financial programs.

HP is expected to complete the latest round of layoffs, between 11,000 to 16,000 people, this month. That is on top of the 34,000 people it had already jettisoned from its payroll.

Another tech stalwart announced a split this month. In a bid to drive growth, eBay Inc. said it would spin off its mobile payment service PayPal into a separate and publicly traded company. Investors sent eBay shares up more than 7 percent on the day of the announcement.

HP maintained its guidance for fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings between $3.70 and $3.74 per share. Analysts polled by FactSet predict earnings of $3.73 per share.

For fiscal 2015, the company anticipates adjusted earnings in a range of $3.83 to $4.03 per share. Wall Street is looking for $3.96 per share.

Shares of Hewlett-Packard Co., based in Palo Alto, California, gained $2.85, or 8.1 percent, to $38.05 before the market open.

336,"The family of beheaded American photojournalist James Foley are facing fresh agony after sick Islamic State militants tried to sell them his headless body for $1million, according to a new report by Buzzfeed.

The website spoke to three middlemen trying to broker the deal, who say they can prove the body is Foley's with a DNA swab and will deliver the remains across the Turkish border once the ransom has been paid.

Foley was the first American hostage to be beheaded by an ISIS militant in a graphic video recording this summer. Since August, the terrorist group overtaking large swathes of Syria and Iraq, has beheaded two more Americans and a Briton in similar displays of barbarism.

Remains: ISIS militants are allegedly trying to sell the body of beheaded American hostage James Foley for $1million. The photojournalist was executed by the terrorist group this past summer, in a highly-graphic video recording (still from the video above)

Victim: Foley was kidnapped from a cafe in a northwestern Syrian town on November 22, 2012. He was working as a photojournalist covering the civil war at the time

The three middlemen interviewed by Buzzfeed include a Syrian rebel fighter, a businessman and an official for the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the U.S.-backed rebel group helping to fight ISIS in the civil war-torn country.

The rebel fighter, who also claimed to have connections to Jubhat al-Nusra (Al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate), called his work 'a humanity case' since he believes returning the body to Foley's parents will help bring them closure.

'They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,' he said. 'They will not give the DNA without the money.'

But the FSA official warned Buzzfeed against publishing the article, believing the U.S. government would shut the deal down if they found out.

Foley was one of 23 Western hostages held by ISIS earlier this year. Fifteen of the hostages were freed when their respective European governments paid millions of dollars in ransoms, but the British and American hostages were left behind since neither country negotiates with terrorists.

Next offer: Before Foley was executed, ISIS allegedly offered to release him if his family paid a $132million ransom, but the amount was not paid since the U.S. does not negotiate with terrorists. Foley's parents John and Diane speak after the video depicting his beheading was released in August

It was previously reported that before Foley's death, his family was approached by the group with a $132million ransom to secure their son's release, but that U.S. officials made it clear that if they paid the ransom themselves it would be an act of treason.

'It will be like a shame for the U.S. government,' the FSA official said, of selling the body. 'People will ask why you brought the body but you didn’t bring him when he was alive.'

The Foley family have not yet commented on the story, and the U.S. State Department told Buzzfeed 'we are seeking more information'.

Holding Western captives for ransom is one of the main ways terrorists groups like ISIS raise money. A New York Times report published this year found that Al Qaeda has made at least $125million from ransoms since 2008, with $66million raised in 2013 alone."
338,"Tonight's Australian Open coverage on ESPN2 featured announcer Chris Fowler explaining to the audience that Japanese pro Kei Nishikori is, among other things, the highest-paid tennis player in the world and the owner of a restaurant chain, a soccer team, and clothing and perfume lines. None of those things are true, and they all come from notorious satire site MediaMass.

Fowler cited Nishikori as having earned $46 million in 2014. The actual number is $11 million, according to Forbes. That makes him the ninth-highest paid player—not the richest.

That's okay, Chris. It happens to the best of us."
351,"London (AFP) - The British government on Saturday said it had received reports that ""Jihadi John"", the British-accented Islamic State militant apparently responsible for the beheading of western hostages, had been injured in a US air strike.

The Foreign Office could not confirm reports published in the Mail on Sunday that the masked executioner, who has appeared in a series of grisly videos posted online, had been wounded while attending a meeting of IS leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last week.

According to the paper, he was rushed to hospital following the US-led attack on a bunker in Al Qaim, western Iraq, on Saturday that killed around 10 IS commanders and wounded 40 more.

The Mail reported that it was the same attack that injured elusive IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, sparking initial rumours that he had been killed.

""Jihadi John"", named after Beatle John Lennon due to his British background, is believed to be responsible for the murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Allan Henning.

Despite being a foreigner, the masked assassin, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, has become a leading figure in the Islamist group that swept across Syria and northern Iraq.

The Mail claimed that a nurse who treated some of those wounded in the attack said there was a man named Jalman on her list, referring to him as ""the one who slaughtered the journalists"".

The wounded men were then driven to the IS's Syrian stronghold of Raqa, according to the Mail's source.

British intelligence officers estimate that there are around 500 home-grown militants fighting for IS in Syria and Iraq, and Prime Minister David Cameron this week announced plans to stop them returning to Britain for two years."
353,"A group of twenty women armed with AK-47 assault rifles stare defiantly at a camera. Most appear to be civilians, although three of them are wearing military-style camouflage uniforms. One woman stands in front of the rest, her rifle aimed forward at waist level. The muzzle appears to have been taped over, possibly to keep dust out of the barrel.

On Twitter, Facebook and the Web, the women have been hailed as heroes in the fight against Boko Haram militants in northern Nigeria. “Nigerian women who repulsed a Boko Haram attack, kudos to these gutsy bravehearts,” read a typical tweet of the image this week.

The photograph has been circulating for some time. We found posts dating to 2013, but the image appears to have gone viral in April 2014, around the time that more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants in Chibok. It has gained renewed currency since this month’s Baga massacre and the battle for the city of Maiduguri.

Boko Haram attack repelled by ‘armed women’

Many of the more recent tweets link to a fringe news website, Countercurrentnews.com, and a post dated 27 May 2014. The photo is prominently displayed. “Another Boko Haram attack repelled by armed women,” reads the headline.

“Several Nigerian media outlets have been reporting on local women in the villages of Attagara and Kawuri in Borno State who recently disarmed nearly a dozen Boko Haram terrorists,” the article continues.

“The notorious pseudo-Islamic terror groups tried to attack the Attagara and Kawuri communities over the weekend but the insurgents were instantly repelled by a group of armed women.”

‘Get ‘em ladies’

Screen Shot 2015-01-30 at 9.40.33 AMA pro-gun Facebook page in the United States that calls itself “Hypocrisy and Stupidity of Gun Control Advocates” has also appropriated the photo, suggesting that it shows a group of Nigerian teachers.

It posted the image on 20 January 2015, along with this caption: “When Boko Haram showed up to kill and rape us and our students we didn’t hide or throw spaghetti-os…We shot them in the face because we don’t ‘demand’ action – we take action.”

The picture was shared more than 400 times and by 30 January 2015, just over 1,200 Facebook users had “liked” it. “You get ’em ladies,” wrote one. “I find their lack of belt fed weapons and RPGs troubling,” said another. “Face shooting is definitely the way to go,” added a third.

Solving a mystery

We were intrigued. Where was the photograph taken? What had happened? Who were the women? Were they teachers? Villagers? Vigilantes? We decided to do a little cyber-sleuthing.

The first clue was a green, yellow and red football shirt worn by a woman in the back row. The second was a bright blue dress worn by another woman with white patches bearing a symbol in similar shades of green, yellow and red. Could they be colours of a national flag?

The Nigerian flag is green and white. The flag of neighbouring Benin is green, yellow and red but not all the bands run parallel. The colours also appear in Mali’s flag. Usually they run vertically, not horizontally, as they do in the football shirt. But a Google search for images of “Mali football jersey” produced photos of football shirts strikingly similar to that worn by the woman in the back row.

Verifying images

Two invaluable tools that we regularly use at Africa Check to establish the veracity of photos circulating online are Google’s image search function and the “reverse image search” engine, Tineye-com. (For more tips, check out our guide to spotting online fakes and hoaxes.)

We uploaded the image to Google. The results weren’t encouraging. There were dozens of links to web pages, Facebook posts and tweets all claiming that the photograph showed armed Nigerian women who had fought off Boko Haram. None offered any details of where the picture had been taken and who had taken it.

In fact, the image had been so widely published in relation to Boko Haram that Google’s suggested search term after we uploaded it was “boko haram women”.

We changed the search term to “Mali” and hit enter.

The claim is a hoax

As it turns out, our hunch was correct. The photo was first published on 23 November, 2012 in The Times of London. It had been taken by a Times photographer, Jack Hill, in the town of Sevare in Mali and accompanied an article by one of the newspaper’s correspondents, Jerome Starkey, about “women bent on revenge against Tuareg rebels in Mali”.

The women – all members of the Ganda Koy militia, a pro-government paramilitary force – had vowed to avenge relatives they said had been killed or raped by Tuareg rebels belonging to the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). Few, if any of the women, had seen combat when the photograph was taken.

The story of the Nigerian teachers standing up to Boko Haram militants is nothing more than a hoax.

A wrap of online fakes and hoaxes

There are numerous images circulating online that purport to show Boko Haram atrocities. Some are genuine. Many are not.

Earlier this month, the militant group attacked the towns of Doro Gowon and Baga in northern Nigeria. Eyewitnesses say hundreds were killed and satellite images obtained by human rights groups show that dozens of shops, houses and buildings were torched.

In the weeks since the attack a series of graphic images have spread online as evidence of what has become known as the “Baga massacre”.

Here’s our wrap of the images we have fact-checked so far.

(WARNING: Some of the photographs in the links below are extremely graphic.)

One of the most disturbing photographs shows dozens of charred corpse lying in rows. However the image actually shows the aftermath of a fuel tanker explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2010.

Another ghastly image shows the burnt corpses of a mother and child. We have been unable to verify its exact origin, but searches on Google and the reverse image search engine, Tineye.com, show that the image has been circulating since at least 2010 and is therefore not from the recent Baga attacks. Given the condition of the bodies, they may have been victims of the fuel tanker explosion, but we cannot say for certain.

Yet another photograph attributed to the Baga massacre shows a crowd clustered around a mass grave. However, that image dates from a massacre near the Nigerian city of Jos in March 2010.

Then there is the image of a number of grotesquely mutilated corpses strewn across a road next to a bus. It was actually taken in 2010. According to a BBC report at the time, a series of photographs emerged after armed robbers attacked a bus on the Lagos-Benin highway. The victims had reportedly been made to lie down in the road and then the bus driver was ordered to run them over.

Even a Reuters photograph of a group of men lying face down outside a police station after their arrest in the city of Bauchi in northeastern Nigeria on 25 July 2009 has been passed off as evidence of the Baga massacres and has spread widely on the web and Twitter.

Another image that has gone viral on Twitter shows a pile of bloodied bodies lying in street. It is also not from Baga but was taken in July 2009 by an Associated Press photographer outside a police station in the town of Maiduguri after clashes between Nigerian troops and Islamist militants left hundreds dead.

Not all the hoaxes involve images of atrocities. A photograph of two men in camouflage uniform being chased by a zebra has been widely distributed as evidence of the Nigerian army’s cowardice. Trouble is, there are no zebras in the wild in Nigeria. It turns out that the photograph was actually taken by a Reuters photographer in Kenya on 30 July 2007. Two Kenya Wildlife Service rangers, working to help move 2,000 animals to the Meru National Park, had to make a run for it when a recalcitrant zebra charged them.

358,"A wicked aunt cut her three-year-old nephew’s penis off when he burst in on her on the loo and asked to use her phone.

Xue Paan, 37, was sending text messages to her boyfriend while sitting on the toilet when toddler Qiang Qiang walked in and asked if he could play a game on her mobile.

But instead of giving him the phone, the fuming aunt went into the kitchen, picked up a knife and severed the boy’s penis while his mother was visiting a next-door neighbour in Luohe, a city in central China’s Henan Province.

Horrified mum Cai Tuan, 27, said: “I had popped out to see a neighbour and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream.

“I ran back to the house and couldn’t believe what I saw.

“Qiang Qiang had fainted and was lying in a pool of blood.

“Next to him was a knife and his penis.

“It was simply horrific.

“My sister, his aunt, had gone.”

Qiang Qiang was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach the penis and was then sent to a specialist clinic in the capital Beijing.

A hospital spokesman said: “Unfortunately, the knife was quite blunt and the cut wasn’t clean so although we reattached the boy’s penis, it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment.

“However, he has now had three surgeries all of which have been successful and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.”

A police spokesman said: “The aunt was arrested and admitted attacking the boy because she was angry that he had interrupted her on the toilet.”

363,"Freelance journalist Steven Sotloff has reportedly been executed by ISIS, Lee Ferran reported Tuesday for ABC News.

“Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life?” Sotloff says calmly as the black clad militant holds a knife casually at his side.
On August 27, Sotloff’s mother, Shirley Sotloff, released a video pleading for her son’s release, Zeke Miller reported for Time. On August 22, Rick Gladstone and Shreeya Sinha wrote about Sotloff for The New York Times.

Described by friends as selfless, Mr. Sotloff spent most of his life in Florida except when he attended a boarding high school, Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, N.H., where he apparently developed a penchant for reporting and writing. He coedited the student newspaper, The Kimball Union, graduated in 2002 and attended the University of Central Florida, where he played rugby, worked for the independent student newspaper, Central Florida Future, and expressed deep interest in travel to the Middle East.
He left after three years and, soon after, began to pursue journalism full-time.

Survivor: Bart, pictured, was pronounced dead, but clawed his way out of the grave and made it to his home in Tampa, Florida

Fighter: Rescuers say Bart probably came to underground and quickly got out - then hid for days before heading home

Hutson told local news station Fox13 that Bart suffered head trauma, a broken jaw and a ruined eye - but very much alive.

Though he still needs surgery before it can be certain he'll pull through, Bart's brush with death saw him escape a muddy grave.

It is unclear how he escaped, but Hutson is convinced that the battered feline who made his way to his neighbor's garden - then on home in the hope of a meal - is his revived pet.

Bart's eye will never work again - even if the surgery goes right - but his survival instincts are clearly on top form.

Rescuers at the Tampa Bay Humane Society, where he is being treated, believed he may have come to underground, escaped and then hid for a few days before gathering the courage to head home.

392,"Four months after beheading American journalist James Foley, ISIS is ransoming his remains for $1 million, according to a new report by BuzzFeed.

Citing sources working as intermediaries for the militants and potential U.S. buyers, reporter Mike Giglio describes ""a grim new method of [ISIS] trying to secure funds"":

Three sources in contact with ISIS or its associates told BuzzFeed News that it wants to sell the remains of James Foley, the U.S. journalist whose August death was the first in a series of high-profile executions of Western hostages by ISIS hands.

They said ISIS wants $1 million for Foley's body, which it would deliver across the border to Turkey, and that the group was willing to provide a DNA sample to facilitate a deal.

“They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,” one of Giglio's sources, a former Syrian rebel fighter, said. “They will not give the DNA without the money.” Another source, however, was more frank about his motivation in helping broker a deal, telling BuzzFeed, ""This is business.""

ISIS reportedly demanded $100 million for Foley's release before eventually beheading him and releasing the video online.

It's U.S. policy to refuse ransom demands; a State Department official BuzzFeed that they are ""seeking more information"" about an alleged ransom for Foley's body.

393,"Justin Bieber recently saved the life of a 42-year-old Russian man.

No, the Biebs didn’t do anything heroic. When Igor Vorozhbitsyn was en route to his favorite fishing spot in northern Russia’s Yakutia Republic, he was attacked by a huge brown bear.

But then, his cell phone rang and the ringtone, “Baby,” scared off the animal.

As the bear started clawing violently at Vorozhbitsyn, the Biebs’ pre-pubescent vocals made the bear’s ears bleed, and it ran off.

Wildlife experts believe it was the fact that the ringtone sounding off was so unexpected that it spooked the bear, but it’s more fun to say the bear just really, really, hated that song.

Vorozhbitsyn suffers from severe bruises on his chest and face and cuts on his neck. Other fishermen found him after he was attacked, and used his phone to call for help.

Vorozhbitsyn says he knows the ringtone “isn’t to everyone’s taste,” but it was his granddaughter that loaded “Baby” onto his phone “for a joke.”

I think, however, that’s just code for “I’m honestly just a true Belieber.”

412,"A 9-year-old girl has stunned her teacher by penning him a touching note after he came out to his class as gay.

The teacher told the class of primary school children about his sexuality after the majority of his students admitted to having heard the word ‘gay’ used in a derogatory way and believing that gay men and lesbians were bad or in some way wrong, during a class on bullying and homophobia.

He explained to Pink News: ‘After speaking to my Head, who was very supportive, we agreed I could tell the class that I’m gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they’re talking about me.’

And although the news was well received by the class, he was taken aback when the unnamed student slipped him this heartfelt note a few days later.

The note opens with the line, ‘Even though you’re gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now’, and concludes, ‘You don’t have to feel scared because I know that everone in the class feels the same way as I do’

The teacher told Pink News: ‘Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson, ‘It’s just your life’. Then she went back to her maths.’

What an inspirational little girl.

421,"Tree Afghan soldiers, who went missing while in Massachusetts for military training, have been found trying to cross the border into Canada, a defense department official said on Monday.

“I can confirm that the Canadians have them,” the defense official said.
The Afghan officers were reported missing late Saturday after a trip to a shopping mall in Hyannis, Mass., about 20 miles from Joint Base Cape Cod where they were involved in a training exercise. Earlier this month, two Afghan police officers disappeared from a DEA training program in Quantico, Va. and were found several days later in the area.

In both cases, the Afghans were part of a chaperoned group that was taken to see U.S. sights and culture, officials said. Both groups were vetted by U.S. officials before they were allowed into the United States.

“There is no indication they pose any threat to the public,” the military said of the trio of officers.

The three were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminy. They arrived at Joint Base Cape Cod on Sept. 11. In addition to Afghanistan, personnel also arrived from Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia.

The exercises took place at Camp Edwards, home to the Massachusetts National Guard and part of Joint Base Cape Cod, which includes a replica of an operating base used by soldiers in areas like Afghanistan.

The training, known as Exercise Regional Cooperation 2014, is one of a series of annual events, sponsored by the U.S. Central Command. Such training has taken place every year since 2004; last year’s exercise was Germany.

The visitors get days off, such as Saturday, the military said. The Afghans were taken to the mall to sight-see and observe aspects of U.S. culture, the spokeswoman said.

On Sept. 13, two Afghan policemen went missing in Washington, D.C., while visiting the U.S. for training in narcotics law-enforcement techniques, Joseph Moses, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The two Afghan officers, who were said to be looking for a better life, were on a chaperoned visit to Washington's Georgetown section when they went off. They were found a few days later and returned to the training program, which ended last week.


The police had been vetted before they arrived and found to be clear of all criminal ties, Moses said.

The incident marked the first time any police had gone missing among the thousands of foreign officers who have received additional training in Quantico, Va., according to authorities."

“Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness,” she wrote. “Now keep me out of this!”

Cosby’s supporters have been few and far between amid the growing chorus of allegations. As Radar has reported, he’s taking a hit to his career, as well, with NBC scrapping their planned sitcom with him, and Netflix postponing a planned stand-up special with the comedian.

426,"The War on Christmas moved to a new battleground this week—a domestic American Airlines flight, where passengers and flight attendants alike alighted with Christmas cheer to overcome a dark force muddling its way down the aisle.

According to the New York Post, the skirmish began when a LaGuardia gate attendant who innocently wished a passenger on a Dallas-bound flight a ""Merry Christmas"" Tuesday.

The grumpy passenger, who appeared to be traveling alone, barked at the woman, ""You shouldn't say that because not everyone celebrates Christmas.""

The agent replied, ""Well, what should I say then?""

""Don't say, 'Merry Christmas!' "" the man shouted before brushing past her.

But the fight was not yet won.

Once on the plane, he was warmly greeted by a flight attendant who also wished him a ""merry Christmas."" That was the last straw.

""Don't say, 'Merry Christmas!' "" the man raged before lecturing the attendants and the pilot about their faux pas.

When the man wouldn't stop his ""hectoring"", the flight crew reportedly turned to the only weapon left in their arsenal—Christmas cheer (and aviation martial law). As staffers began escorting the grinch off the plane, passengers reportedly caught the spirit. We believe in Christmas, they clapped, their shining faces burning with fervor as they reportedly ""burst into cheers and applause."" All is well! All is bright! What'd you get me?

429,"Hewlett-Packard is now forging ahead with plans to split off its PC-and-printer businesses into a separate company, with the rest of the company’s enterprise portfolio staying together in a separate entity to be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, the company said early Monday morning.

The Hewlett-Packard enterprise unit, comprising servers, storage, networking, converged systems, services and software and the OpenStack Helion cloud, will be led by Meg Whitman as president and CEO. Pat Russo will be chairman of that board.

The PC and printer entity, to be known as HP Inc., will be led by Dion Weisler as president and CEO, with Whitman as chairman. The Wall Street Journal (registration required) was first to report this news Sunday afternoon.

“Our work during the past three years has significantly strengthened our core businesses to the point where we can more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,” Whitman said in a statement. “The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan. It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders.”

HP, truly an iconic IT company, has been slammed in the past decade by the shift to mobile devices and cloud and a series of management fiascos including the short-lived tenure of former CEO Leo Apotheker. Under his watch, the company considered selling off its still huge PC business, a plan that was scotched by Whitman when she took the reins in 2011. The rationale behind holding onto the PC business was that it gave HP huge volume buying power advantages in procuring chips and other components for its server business as well.

Toni Sacconaghi, senior analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in a note that while a split up of HP is hardly a new topic, his take is that the spin off  seems to be “fueled by weakness at HP rather than strength.” He also noted that HP in the past few months “came close” to buying Rackspace for nearly $6 billion; nearly bought EMC and “apparently has shopped various parts of its portfolio PCs, its Unix business, IT Services.”

In another research report released before the news was official, Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um wrote:

We believe a separation may suggest HP could become more active in both divestitures and acquisitions, which we believed would be increasingly necessary in FY2015. While this is somewhat of an about face from its prior stance that it was “better together”, we believe this, if true, is likely to be driven by competitive market dynamics as well as a stabilization in its PC business.
The separation, which HP said will be tax-free to shareholders in terms of federal income taxes, is slated to be done by the end of HP’s 2015 fiscal year, ending October 31, 2015.

436,"The Supreme Leader has been out of action for three weeks, making his last appearance in public on September 3.

And now people are asking whether his unhealthy obsession with Emmental cheese is behind the secret condition.

Mr Kim missed a session at North Korea's law-making body, the Supreme People's Assembly, this week - the first time he has been absent since taking power in 2011.

He was last seen with a limp at Moranbong Band concert earlier this month, with speculation that he had ballooned in size as a result of his unhealthy diet.

South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the 31-year-old was ""suffering from gout, along with hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure"".

They attributed his condition to a large amount of drinking and overeating - relating it to his dangerously high consumption of cheese.

Emmental, or Swiss cheese, is made up of 45% fat and large quantities of it can lead to a number of serious health issues.
The leader is said to have gained a habit of munching on the unhealthy dairy product in recent years, which may be a reason behind his disappearance.

A Korean source said last week: “His intake has increased in recent years with the strain of being in power.”

Cho Myung-Chul, a former researcher at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, said he ""probably eats much more than the average North Korean"".

He added: ""North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny.""

Rumours spread that his recent disappearance may have been linked to a sport injury or that he was just on holiday.

And other say the leader may be intentionally gaining weight to look like bloated grandfather Kim Il-sung, who achieved cult status for his national reform in the 1980s.

Mr Cho said: ""There is a high possibility Jong-Un intentionally gained weight to look like Kim Il-sung."""

A pregnant woman has lost an eye after cops reportedly fired a BEAN BAG round through a car window during the Ferguson riots.

Violence erupted in the Missouri city of Ferguson earlier this week following a grand jury decision that white policeman Darren Wilson should not face trial for the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

The destruction and looting that followed is believed to have cost the city millions in repair bills - and several lives have been lost.

Dornella Conner was travelling through the mayhem in the St. Louis suburb on Monday night, when a cop is reported to have fired a non-lethal bean bag round at her boyfriend's car, which smashed the window and left her with severe injuries.

“I will have justice for what they did to me,” Ms Conner wrote on Facebook on Thursday following the incident. “But I’m happy I’m alive.”

Ms Conner and her boyfriend were parked a BP petrol station when police moved in to clear the area, the New York Daily News reports.

Officers made 16 arrests after reporting gunfire coming from the petrol station.

439,"An unconfirmed explosion at a Saudi Arabian oil pipeline briefly sent crude prices higher on Wednesday but the market shrugged off the scare, signalling once again traders' concerns over falling demand.

Pictures of the blast at a small domestic pipeline near Riyadh were posted on Twitter, sending prices of North Sea crude up almost $2 within minutes, before the benchmark fell back to its previous trading range. Brent had been trading down around 0.5pc at just over $82 per barrel before the blast.

Saudi Arabia is the world's largest exporter of crude and has the capacity to pump up to 12.5m barrels per day (bpd) of oil. The kingdom is the most influential member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) as it accounts for about a third of the group's supplies.

The unconfirmed pipeline blast follows a period of violence in Saudi Arabia's volotile Eastern Province, where much of its oil is produced. Masked men are understood to have killed at least five people earlier this week in a Shiite village near the town of Qatif, which is a predominantly Shia area of the Sunni-Muslim controlled kingdom.

Some traders believe that Saudi is willing to tolerate lower oil prices partly to defend the kingdom's share of the energy market in the US, the world's largest economy.

""The largest and most influential Opec producer seems more interested in defending its market shares in an oversupplied market, as well as wishing to curb the shale oil supply flooding the market from the US,"" said Commerzbank. ""To this end, Saudi Arabia is evidently prepared to accept lower oil prices for a certain period of time.""

448,"Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner wants to put an end to werewolf bar mitzvahs once and for all.

Kirchner adopted Argentinian teen Yair Tawil as her godson as part of a folktale that says the seventh-born son in a family will turn into a werewolf and eat unbaptized babies, the New York Daily News reports.

This may sound familiar to fans of 30 Rock:

Source: YouTube

Wait, what? According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared ""el lobizon,"" the Independent explains. The werewolf-like beast ""shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy's 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.""

The legend seems ridiculous, but the Independent reports that fear of the creature was so widespread in 19th century Argentina that some families even murdered their babies. Fear and panic gave rise to the unusual practice of adoption by Argentina's president in 1907, which is meant to quell the deadly stigma ad demystify the folklore that was causing the abuse of children. Now a time-honored tradition, any family with seven sons or daughters today gets the president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.


The boy's parents, Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, had written the president's office requesting the adoption in 1993, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported. President Kirchner reportedly described the adoption as a ""magical moment,"" calling the Tawils a ""marvelous family.""

But are they more marvelous than this?

453,"A teenager woke up in the middle of a brain operation and asked doctors how it was going before chatting about cats.

Iga Jasica, 19, had been taken to the Central Clinical Hospital in the city of Katowice in southwest Poland for the operation to remove a cancerous growth.

But halfway through the critical surgery she woke up after the anaesthetic wore off and started talking to the surgeons about how it was going.

Doctors say her brain was exposed at the time. Neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz said: ""Despite coming round she didn't feel anything and was never in danger.""

He said the young woman would not have been able to see or feel anything. Experts said the operation may have triggered something that caused her to come round despite the anaesthetic, but doctors are also investigating whether the anaesthetic was properly applied.

After the operation Iga said: ""I can't remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great."" - Daily Mirror"
457,"Saudi Arabia airlines has a new passenger plan: Segregation. The Arab state’s national airlines plans to introduce the gender segregation, proving just how far behind the western Asian nation is when it comes to human rights. Complaints were reportedly received by the airlines of men sitting next to their spouses. In Saudi Arabia, one of the very few countries that have rejected adoption of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it’s customary for a female to walk a few feet behind her male counterpart.

Writes RT.com on Jan. 2: “Airline company Saudia will order its staff to keep men and women separated onboard, unless they are close relatives, the Emirates247 news website reported. ‘There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,’ Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, according to Saudi daily Ajel.”

The proposed rule from the Gulf kingdom is in line with strict interpretations of Islamic practices. The complaints were allegedly aired by single, Saudi men who saw other married men sitting directly next to their spouses or female strangers. The airlines has issued an updated set of regulations “to flight booking staff at Gulf airports to keep these new rules in place,” writes the Daily Mail.

The carrier already has number of Islamic guidelines in place – the airline does not offer alcohol (or pork dishes), a prayer from the Quran is uttered before the flight leaves the tarmac, and some flights have an area on the plane designated as a “male prayer zone.” The airlines also will not hire any women from Saudi Arabia – they are employed from surrounding countries only.

The Daily Mail picks up the story: The country is known for its gender segregation, with women requiring a male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home. In public spaces such as restaurants, beaches, amusement parks or banks, women are required to enter and exit through special doors. Women who are seen socializing with a man who is not a relative can even be charged with committing adultery, fornication or prostitution.

UK’s ""The Week,"" in September, published an article entitled Eleven things women in Saudi Arabia can't do. While not the case in all parts of the country, the article says women are unable to walk without a male chaperone, vote, swim, drive, or try on clothes in a store, among other restrictions."
469,"Many people haven’t even gotten their iPhone 6 devices yet, and already the rumors are starting up about what Apple has planned for its next generation handsets.

One slightly sketchy rumor, citing sources in the Apple supply chain in China, suggests 2015’s iPhone lineup could include a 4-inch model, in line with the size of the iPhone 5 and 5s. According to the report, the idea would be to appeal to “female users” who are put off by the larger screen size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

The rumor doesn’t elaborate on whether Apple would create a new 4-inch iPhone from scratch, or refresh a previously launched model instead.

We’re not convinced!

Personally, I’d suggest the report is 99 percent likely to be nonsense. Apple only just upgraded to the larger screen size with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, to both critical and commercial acclaim. Between them, the two handsets smashed records with 10 million+ sales in their first weekend on sale, and analysts are predicting 71.5 million more units will sell over the holidays.

For all the criticisms we’ve heard about the new iPhones, virtually none have suggested both handsets are too big for a substantial portion of users. Larger “phablet” phones have also consistently shown themselves to be the fastest-growing smartphone category — and particularly popular in Asia, which is where Apple is focused on expanding its presence in."

Dubbed Project Chrome internally at IBM, the process will see 26% of the company's workforce laid off in one fell swoop, meaning that 111,800 people could lose their jobs before the end of January based on IBM's global workforce of 430,000.

News of the job cuts come from veteran Silicon Valley reporter Robert X. Cringely, who recently published a book entitled The Decline and Fall of IBM.

RelatedIBM inks $1.25bn cloud computing deal with WPPLenovo Buys IBM's X86 Server BusinessApple-IBM Deal: Why iPad-Maker is Doubling Down on Enterprise

In his report on Project Chrome, Cringely says that those affected by the cuts ""will all be gone by the end of February"". He said that while there would be a significant number of jobs lost in the US, the axe would fall on all of IBM's locations around the world. The cuts in the US are likely to affect the company's mainframe and storage divisions most dramatically.

Falling revenue

Currently the record for the largest single corporate lay-off is also held by IBM, having fired more than 60,000 of its workforce in 1993, but this would be dwarfed if Cringely's predictions come true.

Last year Microsoft hit the headlines when it had its largest ever jobs cull when it laid off more than 18,000 staff in one go.

IBM's problems were underscored last week when it announced another set of weak quarterly revenue figures, its eleventh straight quarter of declining revenue.

Following those results, CEO Ginni Rometty said the company was in transition but made no mention of the huge job cuts: ""We are making significant progress in our transformation, continuing to shift IBM's business to higher value, and investing and positioning ourselves for the longer term.""

IBM's problems stem from the fact that customers are moving their storage infrastructure to the cloud, meaning they no longer need physical data centres on site and therefore don't need service contracts with IBM to help maintain them - a business which accounts for two-thirds of IBM's revenue."
496,"Citigroup analyst Jim Suva weighed in with his expectations for Apple Watch pricing following the news that Apple is hosting a media event on March 9. Apple already announced pricing will start at US$349—presumably for the Apple Watch Sport—and he thinks Apple Watch will cost $550 while the Apple Watch Edition will be priced at $950. He's also pegging April 16 as the smartwatch's official release date.

Citigroup analyst thinks Apple Watch Edition will cost $950, not $5,000Citigroup analyst thinks Apple Watch Edition will cost $950, not $5,000

On Apple's March 9 media event he said,

We expect Apple to give specifics on the launch time, price, and geographic locations, which we estimate as: Launch date: April 16th; Price points: $350, $550 and $950; with a launch limited to the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia in the subsequent months.
Setting Apple Watch Sport at $350 and the standard Apple Watch at $550 falls in line with the general consensus, but the $950 price point he's targeting for Apple Watch Edition comes in well below expectations. Apple Watch Edition ships with a gold body instead of aluminium or stainless steel, and is generally expected to start somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000.

Mr. Suva said he expects Apple will offer a wide variety of accessories for Apple watch with bands starting at $29 and topping out in the hundreds of dollars. He also thinks hundreds of apps will be available on launch day.

He offered up his thoughts on which features we'll see in Apple Watch when it launches saying, ""We expect features to include Apple Pay, adjustable notifications due to personal frequency and preferences, Apple Health, variable haptic feedback, and battery life of one day (under normal use).""

Shoppers hoping to be the first to get an Apple Watch will be able to buy theirs in Apple's own retail stores and through the company's online store. Mr. Suva expects Apple's smartwatch won't be available through other retailers.

Apple sent out media invitations on Thursday for a March 9 event teased as ""Spring forward,"" which is a play on the Day Light Saving change happening on March 8, and likely a thinly veiled hint that we'll be getting more Apple Watch news.

When Apple first showed off its smartwatch last September, we saw three models with a wide selection of bands, support for tracking basic fitness activity such as steps and distance walked, along with heart rate logging. Apple Watch will also offer Apple Pay support, and will require an iPhone to perform many of its tasks.

Mr. Suva has a ""Buy"" rating on Apple's stock along with a $135 target price. Apple is currently trading at $129.59, down 0.82 (0.63%).

[Thanks to Barrons for the heads up]

The Mac Observer Spin
Mr. Suva's $950 price point for the gold Apple Watch Edition is surprisingly low compared to the general consensus that it won't start below $5,000 and could cost more than $10,000. We'll have to wait until Apple's March 9 media event where Apple Watch pricing is expected to be announced to see how close he really is."

A jealous wife in China chopped off her cheating husband’s penis as he slept, then snuck into his hospital room after he had it sewn back on — and hacked it off again and tossed it out the window.

Fan Lung, a dad of five, sealed his fate when he decided to use his wife’s cellphone to send his secret lover a hot and heavy email, Central European News reports.

The 32-year-old forgot to log out of his account after the message was sent, which is how his 21-year-old wife, Feng — who is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm — came across the saucy exchange and snapped.

The jilted wife went berserk, grabbed a pair of scissors, stormed into their bedroom and cut off his penis while he was sleeping.

Lung was rushed to the hospital, where doctors were able to save the appendage and sew it back on.

But Feng was able to sneak into the recovery room, where she chopped his penis off a second time and threw it out the window, according to CEN.

A shocked Lung chased his wife outside, despite losing a lot of blood.

“Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman,” a hospital spokesman said. “He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.”

Despite desperate search efforts, authorities were unable to find Lung’s manhood. Police believe it may have been stumbled upon by a stray dog or cat, according to CEN.

The woman Lung was cheating with — Zhang Hung, 21 — said she’s OK with her man not being able to have more children.

519,"Saudia Airlines – Saudi Arabia's national airline – is planning on segregating passengers after receiving complaints from customers over the free mixing of men and women.

According to the Emirates 247 news website, the new rules would be enforced by airline staff, preventing any one but close relatives sitting next to the opposite gender.

Abdul Rahman al-Fahd, assistant manager at Saudia Airlines, briefly commented: ""There are solutions to this problem. We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.""

The new rules follow Saudia Airline's strong flight code of not offering any alcoholic beverages or pork dishes to customers flying with the airline.

Saudia Airlines chooses not to employ Saudi women as members of the cabin crew, although female flight desks are operating in their offices in the Murooj district in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.

Other Islamic observations are maintained by the airline: most notably a verse of the Quran is read out as prayer prior to take-off. Designated prayer areas for men are also often available on many of its flights.

Many of the airlines run by the Gulf countries abide by Islamic laws, although some country airlines are more lenient than others. For instance, the female airline crew of Etihad, the Emirati airline, do not wear a veil as part of their uniform.

Though the story is fake, it spread like wildfire, seemingly without anyone bothering to research the issue himself or herself.

A source who is a middleman contacted by ISIS to broker the deal told BuzzFeed that the terror group is trying to present it as an act of mercy for the family and a “humanity case,” the Web site said.

The Islamic fundamentalist group, which has overrun large sections of Iraq and Syria, killing thousands of people in the process, had been financing its military by selling oil produced by the wells in the areas it has captured and by collecting ransom from the governments of its non-American hostages.

But with the price of crude oil now plummeting and the United States and Britain standing firmly by their policy to not pay ransoms, ISIS — also known as the Islamic State — devised the plan to sell the corpse.

561,"Tampa, Fla. (CBS TAMPA) – A Tampa massage therapist who calls herself “Jasmine Tridevil” says she spent $20,000 on a procedure to add a third breast to her chest.
The Florida woman told a Florida radio station that she “called like 50 or 60 doctors” in order to have the surgery adding a third breast. The 21-year-old says she saved up for two years for the surgery that she hopes will land her a reality television show on MTV. Tridevil says it’s not just fame and fortune that pushed her to have the surgery – it was also a desire to rebuff men
“My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,” she told Real Radio. “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore… Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”
“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”
Last month, she uploaded a YouTube video of herself modeling in a bikini as Radiohead’s “Creep” plays in the background.
Her “Jasmine Tridevil” social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram have received reactions of disbelief – and support — at her selfie photographs featuring her in bikinis and other outfits displaying her third breast. She said she made many of her own outfits for herself.
Tridevil received the surgery a few months prior, although “it was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.
Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.
Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.
“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said. “My dad is still there for me.”

563,"Oct 6 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.

HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year.

Shares of the company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, were up 5.1 percent at $37 in premarket trading on Monday.

Each of the two businesses contribute about half of HP's current revenue and profit.

The move will result in a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue the fiscal year ending October.

""Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates,"" Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.

Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP, which had a market value of about $66 billion as of Friday.

Many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the personal computer business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations of providing computer servers, networking and data storage to businesses.

HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.

Online auction company eBay Inc said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.

WHITMAN TO LEAD ENTERPRISE

HP's current chief executive, Meg Whitman, will lead the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will house the corporate hardware and services operations.

Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.

HP's printing and personal computing business, to be known as HP Inc, will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc.

Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution.

Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals such as Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which is now the world's No. 1 PC maker by shipments.

Dell Inc, which is HP's closest U.S. competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year.

HP's PC business has shown signs of life in recent quarters, growing broadly geographically as businesses replace aging machines.

HP on Monday affirmed its fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.70 to $3.74 per share. It also forecast 2015 adjusted earnings of $3.83-$4.03 per share, in line with the average analyst estimate of $3.95, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

HP's announcement on Monday confirmed a report of the split in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.

Up to Friday's close, HP's stock had risen nearly 26 percent this year. (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bangalore, David Henry in New York, Edwin Chan in San Francisco and Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Savio D'Souza)

566,"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Houthi rebels took all U.S. Embassy vehicles parked at the Yemeni capital's airport and wouldn't let departing U.S. Marines take their weapons with them, a top Sanaa airport official said about the latest evidence of unrest in an Arab nation long seen as key in America's fight against terrorists.

The actions come after the United States, along with Britain, suspended operations at their embassies and moved out staffers because of the instability in Yemen.

According to the official, the Houthis seized many U.S. Marines' weapons at the airport, and the American troops also handed over some to random airport officials.

However, a senior U.S. military official told CNN the Marines disabled their weapons and gave them to a Yemeni security detail, which had escorted them to the airport, because the Marines were flying commercial.

The U.S. Marine Corps sharply denied the allegations.

""All crew served weapons were destroyed at the embassy prior to movement. None of them were 'handed over' in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan,"" the statement read.

The statement continued: ""To be clear: No Marine handed a weapon to a Houthi, or had one taken from him.""

The previous night, embassy officials burned tens of thousands of documents and destroyed weapons that were inside the Sanaa embassy's storage warehouses, Yemeni employees of the embassy said.

What you need to know about Yemen

Yemen has been an important country to the United States as the home of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the most feared, influential and operational terrorist organizations in the world. U.S. officials have had a long relationship with Yemeni leaders, working with them to target AQAP militants.

But now, Yemen's latest leader, President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, is gone, having resigned after Houthi rebels seized control of key government facilities, dissolved parliament and placed him under house arrest.

All this movement has left the Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- as the pre-eminent power in Yemen.

Their takeover hasn't been smooth and it's not clear whether it will ever be complete. There has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa.

Then there's the question of what it means for the United States and its anti-terrorism efforts.

U.S. special forces stay in Yemen

As of last month, U.S. officials hadn't engaged in talks with the Houthis, though there were discussions about whether to talk to them.

Still, even amid the turmoil, the U.S. military remains active in Yemen.

Take, for instance, the killing of senior AQAP cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari and three other people in a drone strike on their vehicle on January 31.

""They are still capable of conducting counterterrorism operations in Yemen, and frankly ... there's some counterterrorism training that's still ongoing ... with Yemeni security forces,"" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman.

""I'd be less than honest if I said that there hadn't been some adjustments already made because of the political uncertainty,"" he said. ""We're just going to have to watch this closely going forward.""

Yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against AQAP, which has been tied to the failed attempt by ""underwear bomber"" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab and Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan. More recently, the terror group has been linked to the slaughter at French magazine Charlie Hebdo.

""They are a very dangerous group,"" said Kirby. ""They do want to threaten Western interests, including U.S. interests, and we do consider them a threat to the United States of America. We're watching them very closely.""

576,"Despite being heavy competitors with each other, Samsung and Apple do quite a bit more business with each other than some might realize, Samsung has long been a supplier of some Apple product components for iPhones and iPads, and back in January they were rumored to be providing Apple the S1 system-in-package chipset for the Apple watch that debuts later this year. Now there are reports stating that through their Samsung Display arm they may become a future supplier to Apple for displays of the Apple watch. The report also states that LG Display will actually be the first provider of the OLED displays that the Apple watch is said to be using. LG Display also currently makes displays for the iPad.

As we stated above this wouldn’t be the first time that we’ve seen Apple work alongside its competitors, let alone two of its biggest competitors, to bring one of its own devices to market. Apple of course, had to get the Apple watch displays from somewhere because they don’t make their own displays for their products, and seeing as how both Samsung and LG have already produced more than one smartwatch themselves along with the displays on them, should these rumors be true it actually makes a lot of sense. Currently the Apple Watch isn’t available, but it is reportedly going on sale this year in April, and for the time being the rumor states that LG will be the sole supplier at first.

What’s more, is that Samsung is reported to be joining in on the display sales sometime as early as the second half of 2015 or very early 2016 potentially for the next version of the Apple watch, although at this point in time Samsung and LG have both declined to comment on these rumors stated in the South Korean media. Apple has kept quiet on the matter as well. Whether or not there is any truth to these rumors seems to be uncertain for now, but knowing that Apple buys display tech from LG Display already, the rumors are reasonable enough to be at least plausible and it’s certainly possible for LG Display to make more screens for other Apple products."

Lenovo are rumored to be offering around $15 per share for BlackBerry, and may even increase that to around $18 per share, which is quite a bit higher than their current price of around $9.50.

BlackBerry has been turning things around recently, the latest financial results were better than expected, and the company appears to be doing better with their new BlackBerry Passport handsets than previous devices.

Lenovo has big plans for their new smartphone business, and intends to launch a new subsidiary in China that will focus solely on smartphones, so BlackBerry could be a smart buy for the company.

That’s right — the McDonald’s pizza that you knew (and loved?) in the ’90s is still on the menu, but only at two U.S. locations.


FROM EARLIER: Video: McDonald’s explains that its McNuggets are really made from chicken and contain no beaks

As reported by Canada.com, one McDonald’s on the Ohio River and another in Spencer, West Virginia, both owned by Greg Mills, still serve piping hot McPizzas day in and day out.

“According to employee Judy Norman, it’s the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it’s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s,” writes Canada.com’s Ashley Csanady.

Norman tells Canada.com that there are “days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza [order].”

So if you were planning on making a cross-country road trip any time soon, it might be worth altering your route just to make sure you pass through Spencer, West Virginia on your way. After all, McDonald’s should have the pizza ready for you in under 5 minutes:"
594,"The video showing the beheading of U.S. journalist Steven J. Sotloff appears to be authentic, U.S. officials said Wednesday as President Obama said America would not be “intimidated” by Islamic State militants.

“The U.S. intelligence community has analyzed the recently released video showing U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff and has reached the judgment that it is authentic,” said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden.

Sotloff’s family, through a spokesman, issued a statement suggesting they believed the footage to be authentic as well. “The family knows of this horrific tragedy and is grieving privately,” said the spokesman, Barak Barfi.

It was the second such killing carried out by Islamic State militants. Late last month, American journalist James Foley was beheaded in a similar videotaped slaying.

In Estonia, Obama vowed to “destroy” the Islamic State militants and said the United States would “not be intimidated” by the bloodshed.

The Sotloff video, which surfaced online Tuesday, shows a bound and kneeling Sotloff being held at knife-point by a black-clad militant against a desert backdrop similar to the one shown in an earlier video depicting the beheading of Foley.

The gruesome killings and the group’s threat to decapitate other captives put new pressure on the Obama administration at a time when it is weighing how the United States should respond to an al-Qaeda offshoot that is seen as ruthless but that has not carried out plots beyond the region.

The United States has carried out more than 100 airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq over the past month since the group expanded its control of territory there. But the administration has avoided direct U.S. military involvement in Syria aside from a failed attempt to rescue Foley and other captives earlier this year.

The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies have developed lists of possible Islamic State targets in Syria. But Obama, who has expressed concerns about being drawn into Syria’s civil war, indicated last week that he had not yet approved new strikes. “We don’t have a strategy yet,” Obama said in a remark that was later derided by Republican lawmakers and critics.

U.S. officials believe that as many as a dozen Americans may be fighting alongside the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and that the group holds at least two other American hostages, both aid workers.

Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist, had written for Time magazine, Foreign Policy and other publications. He was believed to have been taken captive shortly after entering Syria in 2013, and he was shown in the video of Foley that the Islamic State released last month. Sotloff’s mother, Shirley, recently  released a video pleading with the group for her son’s release.

In the video, an unidentified militant denounces the Obama administration, saying, “I’m back, Obama, and I’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.” He cites recent U.S. airstrikes against the group in Iraq and warns that “just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.”

The militant speaks with a British accent, raising the possibility that he is the same person who killed Foley, 40. Both hostages wore orange jumpsuits, much like prisoners held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Foley and Sotloff may not have been killed at the same time or place. The militant in the Sotloff video appears to refer to U.S. airstrikes at Amerli in Iraq, which began over the weekend. Sotloff also appears to have more hair on his head and face than in the first video.

The latest video, obtained by the Site Intelligence Group, an organization that tracks the online postings of Islamist militant groups, also shows another hostage identified as David Cawthorne Haines. Haines is a British aid worker who was abducted in March 2013 near the Atmeh refu­gee camp adjoining the Turkish border and the Syrian province of Idlib, according to aid workers involved in efforts to secure his release.

In an apparent reference to Britain, Sotloff’s killer warns “governments that enter this evil alliance of America . . . to back off and leave our people alone.” Haines is shown in the same kneeling position and wearing the same type of orange jumpsuit as Sotloff and Foley before him.

Sotloff had traveled into and out of Syria several times before he was abducted after entering the country from Turkey on Aug. 4, 2013, according to a person familiar with the details of his case. The Florida native had covered turmoil in countries including Egypt and Libya, where his reporting served as the basis of a Time magazine reconstruction of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on U.S. compounds in Benghazi.

In the video that surfaced Tuesday, Sotloff stares stone-faced into the camera while delivering a statement apparently scripted by his captors. “I am Steven Joel Sotloff,” he says, adding that he is “paying the price” for the Obama administration’s policies in the Middle East.

The video lasts less than three minutes but appears to have been carefully produced by the terrorist group, which has used online propaganda to position itself as a successor to al-Qaeda and declare itself the leader of a new Islamic caliphate.

The recording opens with footage of Obama’s remarks after Foley’s death, then cuts to video of Sotloff taken from two camera angles. A digital representation of the Islamic State’s black banner flutters in the upper left corner of the frame.

Foley’s killing last month prompted an unusually emotional response from Obama, who interrupted his vacation on Martha’s Vineyard to warn that the United States would be “relentless” against the Islamic State. Obama, who departed Tuesday for a trip to Estonia and Wales, did not publicly respond to Sotloff’s apparent killing.

British Prime Minister David Cameron issued a statement saying that the video, if authentic, depicts “a despicable and barbaric murder” and that the Islamic State fighters “threaten Syrians, Iraqis, Americans and British people alike and make no distinction between Muslims, Christians or any other faith.”

Haines is among several Western hostages believed to be held by the Islamic State, possibly in Raqqah, a Syrian city that serves as the group’s stronghold.

U.S. and British authorities are still seeking to determine the identity of Foley’s killer. His British accent has intensified concerns in Britain and elsewhere in Europe about the large number of European citizens who have flocked to Syria’s civil war over the past four years.

Britain, France and other countries have seen hundreds of citizens depart for Syria, almost all of them carrying passports that would allow them to return to their home countries or travel to other Western nations.

British officials raised the country’s threat level to “severe” last week as the nation’s home secretary warned that terrorist plots were seen as “highly likely” because of the fallout from the conflicts in Iraq and Syria.

617,"Beats Music will eventually disappear as a brand, according to a new report. TechCrunch reports that Apple plans to eliminate the Beats Music streaming service, which it acquired in May, but doesn’t say when. The report is less clear on what Apple plans to do with streaming music. Once source tells TechCrunch that on-demand music could be integrated into iTunes; another source says Apple will make a “significant music announcement” in the first half of 2015.

Engineers from Beats Music have already been transferred to other divisions at Apple, including iTunes, according to the report. As TechCrunch notes, Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers was put in charge of Apple’s ad-supported iTunes Radio product in August and has been splitting his time between the services since then.

When Apple bought the Beats brand for $3 billion, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue called Beats Music “ the first music subscription service done right .” Though it mostly mimicked existing services from Spotify, Rdio, and others, Beats Music tried to differentiate itself through hand-curated playlists and the involvement of music-industry titans like Dr. Dre and Trent Reznor. But after three months it had only 250,000 subscribers, compared to  over 10 million  on Spotify. Still, Cue had positioned Beats as a key component of Apple’s music strategy, saying that the company wanted to offer on-demand listening along with ad-supported radio and digital downloads.
All of which suggests that while the Beats Music brand may be going away, on-demand streaming from Apple could easily take another form. If iTunes is remade as a kind of celestial jukebox that combines your MP3s and on-demand streaming into a single place, the Beats Music brand going away might not be such a bad thing, after all.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Then, as part of anti-bullying week, I’d asked who’d heard ‘gay’ being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned.
“Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.
“After speaking to my Head, who was very supportive, we agreed I could tell the class that I’m gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they’re talking about me.
“The reaction was fantastic – there were a lot of gasps and shocked looks and some basic questions – do you have a boyfriend, etc – but after a couple of minutes they were over it and we moved on to the rest of the lesson.
“The letter came a couple of days later. The little girl who wrote it gave it to me at the start of the day with all the other slips about dinner money, school trips and doctors appointments.
“Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson, ‘It’s just your life’. Then she went back to her maths.
“For my class it was a surprise sure but, to them, it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgement, no follow up, just acceptance.

The woman, a 52-year-old resident of Changwon who has not been named, was awoken by the pain and, unable to extricate herself from the robot, called the fire department for help.

She was eventually freed by paramedics, escaping serious injury but losing several strands of hair.

It required two paramedics to remove her hair from the machine's nozzle, Korea Biz Wire reported.

The incident, which took place on January 3, highlighted the potential risk of this type of accident in South Korea, where sitting and sleeping on the floor is common practice.

The vacuum only stopped running more than a minute after initially ingesting the woman's hair.

She was still unable to free herself from the vacuum and made a ""desperate rescue request"" call to 119, South Korea's emergency telephone number.

Robotic vacuum cleaners are equipped with sensors allowing them to clean surfaces by detecting dirt while avoiding obstacles such as stairs, people and cables - but not, seemingly, human hair that is still attached.

641,"The ship left Sierra Leone on July 13 2014 in destination of the Mexican city of Tampico. Six days after leaving the port of Freetown, the captain of the ship reported in a radio communication that three of the crew members were beginning to show distressing symptoms that suggested they could be infected with ebola, and that the ship was changing course to head towards Cape Verde to get some medical help. This was the last time that the crew was heard of, and all 17 men on board are presumed to have died in only a few days later.

The ship could now pose an important threat to the American public, as the ship is believed to be infested with thousands of starving rats possibly carrying the ebola virus. Many of the witnesses who came across the ship over the last months, have indeed reported seeing the rodents feeding off the crew’s bodies as the ship went by. Experts fear that these animals could now spread the disease to humans and other animals on the continent, creating an uncontrolable ebola pandemic in the United States.

The ship is believed to be infested with thousands of ebola-ridden rats, fear local health authorities

The Guinean Luck has been reported multiple times in the Atlantic Ocean, drifting away slowly along the North Equatorial Current towards the American continent. It has been sighted almost a dozen times since November 2014, by various ships sailing north of the Antilles. It was last reported to have been seen by fishermen, only a few nautical miles North of the territorial waters of Bahamas.

Despite their efforts, the American authorities have not been able to locate the ghost ship, but some recent satellite pictures showing the ship have enabled them to narrow the search area to approximately 400 square nautical miles (nearly 1375 km² or 530 square mile). A total of 324 coast guard ships and 32 helicopters have already been affected to the search operations, forming the largest search force ever created by the U.S. coast guard.

Ships and officers of the U.S. Coast Guard from the entire East Coast have been mobilized in a desperate attempt to find and sink the ship before it reaches America.

Experts and analysts estimate that the ship’s actual course and speed will bring it to land or be washed ashore in Southern Florida over the next weeks, probably near the densely populated Miami area. The authorities remain confident however, that the ship will be found and sunk before it reaches the coast."

The move would be curious, as Apple paid what many considered to be a hefty sum for the headphones and streaming music service at the time.

It doesn't necessarily mean Apple's lost interest in streaming music, however. More likely it's an effort to unify brands, said the report.

According to sources interviewed by TechCrunch, engineers working on Beats have already been moved to other projects, like iTunes.

647,"With Apple Watch’s launch day edging ever closer, the company is reportedly preparing to make some changes at its global chain of stores in order to accommodate the most expensive version of its new smartwatch.

The tech company is said to be bringing tailor-made safes to its retail locations for the secure overnight storage of its gold Apple Watches, a move that it hopes will help deter nefarious types from considering a late-night shopping expedition of the smash ‘n’ grab variety.

The specially designed safes will hold demo devices as well as on-sale stock, and come equipped with MagSafe chargers so the demo units can begin each day fully charged, a source told 9to5Mac.

The smartwatch model set for the special treatment – the Apple Watch Edition – incorporates a case crafted from 18-karat gold that Apple claims has been specially developed to be up to twice as hard as standard gold. It also features a display protected by polished sapphire crystal.

While it’s rare for Apple Stores to get hit by raids, it has been known to happen. With a new and expensive product about to arrive, it could make the stores more of a target, so it’s little surprise that the company is reportedly taking special measures to deter criminals.

The exact price of this particular version of Apple’s smartwatch is yet to be announced, though considering its premium materials, as well as the fact that the Cupertino company is acting to safeguard units outside of regular trading hours, it’s fair to assume that customers who go for the Edition will be laying down several thousand dollars at the least.

A Tampa massage therapist, Jasmine Tridevil, underwent surgery to get just that. Tridevil told Orlando radio station Real Radio 104.1 that she spent close to $20,000 on the procedure.

Tridevil told the station that she contacted more than 50 doctors before finding one who would give her the third breast. ""It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she said. The surgeon she found couldn't create a silicone areola, though, so she had one tattooed onto the implant, which is made from silicone and skin tissue from her stomach.

While Tridevil's dream is to star in an MTV reality show, she told the radio station she had the surgery to become ""unattractive to men"" in addition to gaining fame. ""I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

665,"DEVELOPING: Three Afghan National Army officers who vanished from a Cape Cod military base where they had been taking part in a training exercise have reportedly been found near Niagara Falls, where they were trying to cross into Canada.

The men, reported missing by the Massachusetts National Guard, were first reported missing Saturday night at Joint Base Cape Cod late Saturday. A statement identified the soldiers as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, 48, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada, 18, and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar, 20.

A federal source told MyFoxBoston.com the men were caught at the border on Monday. The report could not be confirmed.

Earlier, Pentagon officials who spoke to Fox News said they did not feel that the missing soldiers posed a public threat. U.S. military officials told The Associated Press that the men arrived at Camp Edwards on Sept. 11. They were last seen during a day off at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis.

Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady told the Cape Cod Times that the men “had the freedom to come and go.”

""If they were off-duty, they could go to McDonald's or the mall,” he said.

Base and exercise officials were working with local and state authorities to locate the soldiers, who were taking part in a U.S. Central Command Regional Cooperation exercise.

The exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation and interoperability among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.

Col. George Harrington, battle group commander for the exercise, told the Cape Cod Times that the day the soldiers disappeared was a chance for participants to visit Cape Cod beaches and be treated to a traditional lobster boil back on the base.

This year's exercise, which involves more than 200 participants from six nations, including the U.S., wraps up on Wednesday. There are about a dozen Afghan soldiers still taking part in the exercise.

A Cape Cod Times reporter who attended a training exercise on Friday observed that none of the soldiers involved were carrying weapons.

This year is the first time the exercise has taken place on U.S. soil since 2006, the Cape Cod Times reported. The events are usually held in South Asia.

""This is a valuable opportunity for the Massachusetts National Guard and is personally rewarding,"" Harrington told the newspaper.

675,"A female Kurdish fighter who became a poster girl for the Kobane resistance movement after a picture of her making a peace sign was retweeted thousands of times on Twitter has reportedly been beheaded by Isis.

The woman, known by the pseudonym Rehana, was celebrated as a symbol of hope for the embattled Syrian border town after a journalist tweeted a picture of her making a 'V-sign', claiming that she'd personally killed 100 Isis militants.

The message was retweeted over 5,000 times, but there are now claims Rehana, who fought for the Kurdish YPJ, or Women's Defense Unit, may have been killed after gruesome pictures began circulating on Twitter of an Isis fighter purportedly holding aloft her head.

A female Kurdish fighter who became a poster girl for the Kobane resistance movement after a picture of her making a peace sign was retweeted thousands of times on Twitter has reportedly been beheaded by Isis

Her death - reported on several sites including 9News.com - however, is unconfirmed and at the time of writing the YPG (People's Defense Unit) and YPJ have yet to respond to MailOnline's request for a comment.

Perched on the other side of the Turkish border, the Syrian town of Kobane has been under an intense assault by Isis, or the so-called Islamic State, for more than a month. The town - surrounded on the east, south and west by Isis - is being defended by Kurdish forces in Syria.

Among those fighters are thousands of women, an unusual phenomenon in the Muslim world in which warfare is often associated with manhood.

In April, Kurdish fighters created all-female combat units that have grown to include more than 10,000 women.

Brave: Thousands of Kurdish women are fighting Isis in Syria

These female fighters have played a major role in battles against IS, said Nasser Haj Mansour, a defense official in Syria's Kurdish region.

The Kurdish women now find themselves battling militants preaching an extreme form of Islam dictating that women only leave the house if absolutely necessary.

One Kurdish female fighter, who uses the nom de guerre of Afshin Kobani, used to be a teacher.

Now, the Kurdish Syrian woman has traded the classroom for the front lines in the battle for the town.

The 28-year-old Kurdish fighter said she decided to join the fight in her hometown when she saw Isis advances in Syria.

'I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,' said Kobani, who declined to reveal her birth name. 'This is our land - our own - and if we don't do it, who else will?'

After more than a year of fighting, Kobani has risen through the ranks to become a commander of a mixed-gender unit. 'We are just the same as men; there's no difference,' she said. 'We can do any type of job, including armed mobilization.'

There is nothing new about Kurdish women fighters. They have fought alongside men for years in a guerrilla war against Turkey, seeking an independent Kurdistan which would encompass parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran.

Earlier this month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors events in Syria, reported Isis militants beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women

The campaign for Kurdish independence has been pursued mainly by leftist militant groups that championed gender equality, such as the Kurdistan Workers Party in Turkey.

Suicide bombings have long been part of the Kurdish women fighters' battleground repertory.

Early this month, Deilar Kanj Khamis, better known by her military name Arin Mirkan, blew herself up outside Kobani, killing 10 IS fighters, according to Kurdish forces.

Haj Mansour, the Kurdish defense official, recounted that Kurdish fighters were forced to withdraw from a strategic hill south of the besieged town. Khamis stayed behind, attacking IS fighters with gunfire and grenades as they moved in.

Surrounded, she detonated explosives strapped to her body. The Kurds then recaptured the position - but lost it again on Wednesday.

681,"A man at New York City's LaGuardia Airport was removed from a plane after the Christmas spirit turned out to be too much for him.

As he was boarding American Airlines Flight 1140, headed to Dallas on Tuesday, an airline employee wished him a ""Merry Christmas,"" according to the New York Post.

He lectured the employee about how it was inappropriate to say that to everyone, because not everyone celebrates the holiday. Unfortunately that was not the end of it. The Post:

Once on the plane, he was warmly greeted by a flight attendant who also wished him a “merry Christmas.” That was the last straw.

“Don’t say, ‘Merry Christmas!’ ” the man raged before lecturing the attendants and the pilot about their faux pas.

The crew was unable to calm the man, and he was eventually removed from the flight (to the cheers of the other passengers).

The flight left LaGuardia about 40 minutes late, according to FlightAware.

For proper greeting etiquette, Mashable turns to Miss Manners, who says annoyance at ""Merry Christmas"" is understandable but ""friendly overtures require pleasant replies.""

""While some people are offended by 'Christmas,' because they do not celebrate it, even more are offended by 'merry' because they do not feel it,"" she says.

But even though it's proper to respond to a well-intentioned greeting in kind, the holiday spirit can be a little overwhelming this time of year.

The 81-year-old comedian was scheduled to receive just an endoscopy at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, but after the clinic’s medical doctor Lawrence Cohen finished the procedure, an unidentified doctor performed an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords.

Investigators think that Joan‘s vocal cords began to swell during the biopsy, which caused oxygen to stop flowing to her lungs. This led to her going into cardiac arrest.

Dr. Cohen “is not currently performing procedures…nor is he currently serving as medical director” following Joan‘s death. Despite this, the clinic denies that the vocal cord biopsy was performed at the clinic."
697,"If you've been anywhere even remotely near a computer today, you've probably heard that Argentina's president recently adopted a young Jewish man to stop him from turning into a werewolf. And why not—it's internet gold! Also, as it turns out, not even remotely true.

According to the Washington Post, the story of the day is as follows:

A tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf — known as ""el lobison"" in Argentina — after his 13th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form, feeding on the dead and murdering all before it.... The fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born, which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing.
While, yes, seventh sons and daughters in Argentina are eligible to become the godson or goddaughter (read: not the adopted child) of the country's president, as The Guardian points out, Jewish werewolf-hood has no part in the tradition. Which is fairly evident from Argentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's tweets depicting the country's newly announced first Jewish godson.

Top translation: They brought me a menorah. They asked me to light it. Bottom translation: I didn't realize it, but their visit coincided with Hanukkah.

But, as The Guardian points out, this nice, totally innocuous event somehow got mixed up with an ancient, werewolf-esque myth called the lobizón:

But somehow, the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón(Argentina's equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.

Evidently, the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colorful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible – confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behavior from national leaders in the continent of magical realism.

In fact, the only connection between the two tales is that they center around seventh children. There is an actual, century-old tradition in which every seventh child born to an Argentinian family is eligible to become the president's godchild—a practice originating from Czarist Russia. The tale of the lobizón, on the other hand, started amongst Argentina's gauchos and has nothing whatsoever to do with the president's newly minted godson.

So sorry to burst your bubble, internet—no werewolf Jewish godsons this time. But hey, at least it got us talking about this again. [The Guardian]

710,"The family of slain journalist James Foley are claiming Obama Administration officials repeatedly threatened them, asserting that they could be prosecuted for supporting terrorism if they paid a ransom to the ISIS militants holding their son.

Both Foley’s mother and brother made the allegations this week, according to ABC News. The threats, which were made to the Foley family over the summer, reportedly came from a highly decorated military official who serves on the White House’s National Security Council. Five current or former officials with knowledge of the Foley case made the same allegation to ABC News in recent weeks.

“Three times he intimidated us with that message,” Diane Foley claimed. “We were horrified he would say that. He just told us we would be prosecuted. We knew we had to save our son, we had to try.”

The NSC released a statement on Thursday, in which spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden addressed the implications of paying ransom to terrorist groups.

“Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL [ISIS], are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately.”

Officials also told Foley’s family not to deal with the press, and indicated that the government would not exchange prisoners or take military action to rescue James Foley, according to CNN. Foley’s brother Michael also claimed that he was directly threatened with prosecution.

“Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,” Diane Foley said, adding, “As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.”

As The Inquisitr has previously reported, James Foley was murdered by ISIS militants, and a video posted online on August 19 shows his summary execution by beheading. In the weeks following his death, it was revealed that the United States had launched a mission to recover Foley and other captives this summer inside Syria, though the hostages had been moved by the time commandos arrived.

Foley’s family said that the threats slowed their fundraising efforts to obtain the ransom, as they feared donors would also face prosecution.

711,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (JTA) — Argentina’s president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves.
President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.
Tawil was adopted under a law passed in the 1920s to counteract a legend that a seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf. Belief in the legend was once so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.
Under the law, the boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday. Until 2009, the law only applied to Catholic boys.
Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.
On Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina’s history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.
The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”
She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.
CORRECTION: The original brief stated incorrectly that Shlomo Tawil was the director of the Chabad House in Rosario, located in central Argentina. The sentence has been deleted."
733,"THIS seaside town might be famed for its oysters, but this incredible image could soon have visitors flocking to Whistable in the hope of catching Britain’s biggest crab.

The photograph, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 15-metres wide lurking in shallow water.

While some insist it is proof of ‘Crabzilla’, others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank — or is simply a playful hoax.

The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour — dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier.

It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches.

The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable — an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

Its curator, Quinton Winter, said that at first he thought the image — sent to him by a follower — showed an unusual sand formation, but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep.

He said: ‘At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, “that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood”.

‘It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

‘Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.’

The largest known species of crab is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 3.5-metres. So we’re betting this ‘15 metre crabzilla’ is the work of one very talented photoshopper!"

If the video does indeed depict Sotloff's death, it would make him the second American journalist to be executed by agents of the Islamic State (IS), sometimes known as ISIS or ISIL.

Previously, ISIS released footage of a British jihadi ('Jihadi John') killing Jim Foley, an American journalist snateched while on freelance assignment in Syria. In that video, after executing Foley, the militant brings out a man identified as Sotloff and says his life ""depends upon…[Obama's]...next decision."" The man cites ""aggression"" against IS by the U.S. and says, ""to deny Muslims their safety of living under the caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

In response to the release of the Foley video, the U.S. ramped up its attacks against ISIS. President Obama asked for the help and support of the Iraqi and Syrian peoples and battling the group, which he said ""has no place in the 21st century.""

Sotloff has been missing in Syria since Aug. 4, 2013, when he was abducted after crossing into Syria from Turkey.

""I am Shirley Sotloff. My son Steven is in your hands. You, the caliph, can grant amnesty. I ask you please to release my child,” she said. “I ask you to use your authority to spare his life.”

In the past few weeks, authorities have discovered bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other organs in several shallow mass graves, leading many to believe that the extremist group might be harvesting these organs to fund its caliphate, Mohamed Alhakim, the Iraqi envoy to the U.N., reportedly said.

“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” The Associated Press (AP) quoted Alhakim as saying. “It is clear they are missing certain parts.”

The official also said that ISIS had executed several doctors in the northern Iraqi town of Mosul for refusing to harvest organs from its victims. Alhakim also accused ISIS of being guilty of “crimes of genocide” as it targets ethnic groups.

“These terrorist groups have desecrated all human values. They have committed the most heinous criminal terrorist acts against the Iraqi people whether Shi'ite, Sunni, Christians, Turkmen, Shabak or Yazidis,” Russia’s RT news agency quoted Alhakim as saying.

The U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, also told the council that there are numerous reports to support the claim that ISIS is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.

“It’s very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day… Almost daily terrorist attacks continue to deliberately target all Iraqis, most notably the Shi’ite community, as well as ethnic and religious minorities, across the country,” Mladenov told the council, adding that at least 790 people were killed in January during armed conflicts in Iraq.

In December, al-Monitor had reported that foreign doctors were harvesting organs for ISIS in Mosul. The report also claimed that there had been an “unusual movement” in medical facilities in Mosul, where “Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors.”"

But then, with what turned out to be extremely fortuitous timing, the 42-year-old man’s cell phone started ringing. The Justin Bieber song “Baby” started playing, and the bear — who was either frightened by the sound or who perhaps is a Bieber fan himself and wanted to go easy on a fellow Belieber — fled.

“I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” Vorozhbitsyn said. “I know that sort of ringtone isn’t to everyone’s taste, but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke.”

After the bear fled, Vorozhbitsyn called for help and was rescued by fishermen. He is now recovering from the attack, which left him with cuts and bruises around his face and chest.

762,"Apple will begin shipping the Apple Watch in March and will also look to launch its new 12-inch MacBook Air during this quarter, according to a new report by KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo. The analyst also predicted that iPhone shipments would beat expectations for Q1 2015 with over 61 million units shipped, while iPad shipments are expected to total to 10 million units.

Kuo notes that Apple may reveal more details about the Apple Watch before its official launch, revealing specifics on battery life and the start of pre-orders. Most components of the Apple Watch will see high shipments during the quarter, but other key components are expected to see low production yields which may cause a constrained supply. Kuo predicts that Apple will ship 2.8 million Apple Watch units in Q1 2015, and his estimate for a March launch falls in line with previous reports.

Kuo's estimate for a Q1 2015 launch of the new 12-inch MacBook Air falls in line with a report earlier this month which stated that Apple supplier Quanta Computer was ramping up production of the notebook for a release this quarter. The 12-inch MacBook Air is expected to feature a new ultra-thin, fan-less design with a high resolution Retina display and a low-power Intel Core M processor. The notebook is also said to be one of the first to take advantage of the new reversible USB Type C connector, which may also be used for charging.

Three separate collections – Watch, Sport, and Edition – will be available, each running on an iOS-based software called Watch OS.

791,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is in serious discussions to buy Mojang AB, the Swedish company behind the popular ""Minecraft"" video game, The Wall Street Journal said, citing a person with knowledge of the matter.

The deal is be valued at more than $2 billion and could be signed as early as this week, the Journal reported.

""Minecraft"" is a game where players build structures with blocks to protect against nocturnal monsters.

The acquisition will add to Microsoft's Xbox video game business, at a time when the competition in the video game console market is heating up.

Microsoft said in April it had shipped 5 million Xbox One units to retailers worldwide since the launch. In the same month Sony Corp (6758.T) said it had sold more than 7 million PlayStation 4 units as of April 6 and was struggling to keep up with consumer demand.

Microsoft declined to comment."
792,"Once thought to be a key component of Apple's acquisition of Beats, the Beats Music subscription service and accompanying brand will apparently be shuttered, leaving just iTunes-related software services, according to a new report.

Citing five sources at Apple and Beats, TechCrunch reported on Monday that although the exact timetable is unknown, Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music service and brand. People involved in the product are said to have already been moved onto other projects at the company, including iTunes.

If true, the move would be a change from May, when Apple emphasized Beats Music as a key component of its $3 billion purchase of the headphone maker. The Beats Music product received top billing over Beats Electronics in Apple's press release announcing the deal, even though the headphone making side of the business is the brand's most recognizable role.

Observers also believed that the Beats Music service allowed Apple to enter a key subscription market where the iTunes Store and iTunes Radio do not compete. Sales of digital albums have been declining in recent years as customers have migrated to competing services like Spotify and Pandora.

But Beats Music also got off to a slow start, with just 110,000 subscribers as of March. Its performance since being acquired by Apple remains unknown.

The rumor would suggest that Apple's $3 billion buyout of Beats was really about the headphones side of the business, as well as the talent and credibility brought on by the ""acqui-hires"" of Beats's Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.

Iovine is a longtime music industry executive and was a personal friend of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Both he and Dr. Dre have considerable sway in the industry and could help secure content for Apple's iTunes business.

When it was announced earlier this year, Apple's $3 billion buyout of Beats proved controversial, with critics suggesting that the iPhone maker had overpaid for a company better known for its brand than quality products. But proponents believe the addition of Beats products to Apple's portfolio will help the company earn revenue from a lucrative accessories market where the company did not previously compete.

Update: In a statement to Re/code, Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said the TechCrunch rumor is ""not true,"" but did not offer further comment on the matter. The publication cites sources at Apple as saying branding for Beats Music could change in the future, though the streaming service itself will remain active."
801,"In Q1 2015, we expect that Apple could very well release at least two new products – the Apple Watch and the 12-inch MacBook Air. We have heard two separate rumors that the former will be launched in March and the latter will see a general Q1 2015 release, but if you’re still a little skeptical, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has basically “confirmed” it.
Kuo has been known for his pretty accurate predictions regarding Apple’s product lineup and their release timeframes, so there could be some truth in his claims. According to Kuo, he confirms that Apple will indeed be releasing the Apple Watch in March and the upcoming 12-inch MacBook Air later on in the quarter as well, but no specific dates were provided.
According to Kuo, the Apple Watch could see some supply constraint. This is due to key components of the wearable having low production yields, but Kuo notes that this is not an issue for the other components which should see high shipments in this quarter. He also expects that Apple will ship 2.5 million Apple Watch units in Q1 2015 alone.
Kuo also predicts that Apple will reveal more details about the Apple Watch ahead of its release and offer up more detailed information about its battery life and when pre-orders will begin, which we guess sounds pretty probable. However as is the case with all rumors, they’re best taken with a grain of salt for now, but do check back with us in the coming weeks/months where hopefully we will have more details for you."
802,"Seems like the President of Argentina Cristina Fernández Kirchner did not exactly save a Jewish boy from becoming a werewolf. Apparently this is what happens when a tradition and an urban legend get intertwined. The tradition does dictate that the seventh child born to an Argentine family with six consecutive children of the same sex is eligible to become the godchild of the president; and the urban myth says this child’s fate is unlucky as it is meant to become a werewolf sooner or later. So technically Lair Tawil was safe.

According to the real legend of the ‘lobizón’ (or werewolf) it is only the seventh son of the seventh son who could be potentially cursed. The Guardian reported Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda said, “The local myth of the ‘lobizón’ is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president.”

The tradition of the president adopting a seventh child began in 1907 when then-president José Figueroa Alcorta, was asked by Russian immigrants Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann to become their son’s godfather. “The couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia, where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons, and Argentina’s president accepted.”

Although Isabel Perón passed the law in 1974, it’s still so that not every seventh child is eligible to become a presidential godchild; the honor is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively, with no daughters in between. The president with most godsons was Juan Perón, who had 1,982 over three terms in office. Kirchner has already become the presidential godmother of almost 700 children since taking office in 2007, and for all we know, she might've saved a few from becoming werewolves."
810,"A Russian fisherman says the only thing that prevented a brown bear from killing him was Justin Bieber—specifically, a ringtone of Bieber's first big hit, ""Baby.""

Igor Vorozhbitsyn, 42, had parked his car and started walking toward the fishing spot he'd marked out for that day when the bear jumped him from behind.

""There was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me,"" he said, according to the Daily Mail.

The bear mauled Vorozhbitsyn's face and chest, inflicting serious cuts and bruises. He believes it probably would have killed him if his phone hadn't gone off in the nick of time, blaring ""Baby"" loudly enough to drive the bear away.

After narrowly escaping death, he also escaped a lifetime of being known as a Belieber.

""I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,"" the fisherman said.

The Mail quotes a bear expert as saying there wasn't anything about Bieber's music in particular that bears find offensive, but ""sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks, and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear.""

""What's up, bitch?"" Bieber said, albeit earlier and in a completely non-bear-related context."

Orlando Bloom may be glad to know he is not the only one who can’t stomach Justin Bieber.

The Lord of the Rings star’s latest ally in his fallout with the pop loudmouth is a wild Russian Bear - who found the singer truly unbearable.

The beast had pounced on fisherman Igor Vorozhbitsyn and would have certainly have killed him .... until Igor’s phone went off and played Bieber’s hit Baby. So grisly did the mighty grizzly find the ringtone tune that it turned tail and fled back into the forest.

Recounting his terrifying experience in northern Russia’s Yakutia Republic, badly mauled Igor said: “I was walking to my fishing spot when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me. I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled. My granddaughter had loaded the ringtone onto my phone for a joke.”

Wildlife experts believe it must have startled the bear into halting its attack. “That ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,” said one.

The law, which states that women with alluring eyes will be forced to wear a full veil, has been branded ‘stupid’ by dissenters and roundly criticised on social media, aina.org reports.

Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of the Saudi Arabian Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, said they ‘had the right’ to force women to cover their face.

‘The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones,’ he said.

‘We have the right to do so.’

Many commentators wondered how the word ‘tempting’ would be applied.

One unnamed journalist in the country suggested it referred to ‘uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup.’

‘Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble,’ they added.

Prince Naif, whose impending ascension to the Saudi throne many hoped would spell an end to this kind of draconian oppression, looks likely to be as intolerant as his father King Abdullah after suggesting that any Muslim should support the Committee’s new law.

835,"The video comes after the beheading of journalist James Foley last month

Kashmira Gander writes for the Independent and Independent on Sunday

Tuesday 02 September 2014

Islamic State (IS) fighters have released a video which they claim shows the beheading of US journalist Steven Sotloff, followed by a threat that a British hostage could be next.

Sotloff, 31, who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, had last been seen in Syria in August 2013 where he was working as a reporter.

Last month, he appeared at the end of a video released online by the extremist group formerly known as Isis that showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley.

In the footage last month, Sotloff was pictured dressed in an orange jumpsuit against the backdrop of an arid landscape. IS fighters then threatened to kill Sotloff unless the US stopped air strikes against the group in Iraq.

The video distributed today begins with a short excerpt from a speech by US President Barack Obama on the fight against terror, followed by text that reads: ""A second message to America"". The IS fighter, who suggests he is the same man who killed Mr Foley, says: ""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State...despite our serious warnings.""

He then appears to be behead Mr Sotloff.

The footage ends with the threat of presenting a British hostage, and issuing a warning to ""back-off and leave our people alone.""

Journalist Steven Sotloff, left, pictured in Libya in 2011 (Getty)  The White House has said it cannot confirm the authenticity of the video. Spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports, BBC New reported.

A US terrorism watchdog, the SITE Intelligence Group, first reported the video's existence.

Following Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother had appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to spare her son's life.

In a video in which she directly addressed the IS leader, she urged that her son was an ""an innocent journalist"" who had no control over US policy in the Middle East.

836,"Jermell Hasson spent his summer sleeping in a parking lot in Ferguson to join the protests over Michael Brown's shooting by police. Hasson's reward was to become racist America's favorite meme, after a doctored image of him was shared thousands of times across the internet's dark, sticky id-corners.

Riverfront Times photographer Mitch Ryals snapped an innocuous shot in September of Hasson carrying a sign with fellow protesters that read ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he leaves home,"" with the hashtags ""#blacklivesmatter"" and ""#stayhuman"":

Brown was suspected of helping to knock over a convenience store before the confrontation with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson that led to the teen's death.

Riverfront Times caught up with one local man, Jim Gleason, who was apparently one of the first to share the made-up image on Facebook with the note ""You can't make this up!!!!"" (It was subsequently shared more than 28,000 times.) Gleason explained to the Times what was apparently self-evident to him and other fans of the image—that suspected robbers of convenience stores should be summarily shot:

Gleason says he is surprised and saddened by the backlash to the photo he posted because ""qualified investigators at all levels of government"" concluded that Brown robbed the convenience store before his death.

""It appears that this young man robbed a store, assaulted a police officer, and it is just surprising to me the uprising when the physical evidence seems to be overwhelmingly in support of the police officer's actions,"" Gleason says.
A handful of critics have taken to the Facebook page of Gleason's St. Louis business—a signmaking business—to express their frustrations.

Hasson called the image-doctoring a ""slander,"" but he seems to be taking it in stride. ""It shows that we are making a difference out here,"" he told the Times:

For someone who has nothing better to do with their life than photoshop a sign, it shows me that we haven't been out here since August for no reason. They're trying to stop the movement, which they can't."
849,"TALLAHASSEE — A lawyer and Florida State University alum was identified by police Thursday as the gunman whose rampage left three people wounded and sent hundreds of panicked students scrambling for exits and ducking for cover.

Officers responding to 911 calls early Thursday fatally shot Myron May, a 2005 FSU grad who had moved back into the area in recent weeks,Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said.

""He refused to surrender and as a result he was shot and killed by officers,"" DeLeo said. DeLeo did not say whether May fired at police, a contention cited by a department spokesman earlier in the day.

DeLeo said May and written documents and made videos that discuss ""being targeted."" May's Facebook page includes Bible verses and links to conspiracy theories about the government reading people's minds.

""Mr. May was in a state of crisis... struggling either psychologically or emotionally,"" DeLeo said.

One victim was hospitalized in critical condition and another in good condition, a spokesperson for Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare said. A third person was grazed by a bullet and was treated at the scene and released.

Campus Police Chief David Perry said classes will resume Friday and the library will reopen. He promised a strong police presence. Officials canceled classes Thursday but kept the campus open and made counseling available to students and staff.

""We will get through this as a community, we will get through this as a university,"" Perry said.

More than 300 students were in Strozier Library when the shooting began at about 12:15 a.m. DeLeo said May, firing a semiautomatic .380 caliber weapon, never got past the library lobby.

Jason Derfuss, 21, said he was leaving the library when the shooter opened fire near him. Derfuss posted on Facebook pictures of a bullet and a book, Great Medieval Thinkers: John Wyclif, the bulllet had torn through. Derfuss says in his post he was near the gunman when the shooting started but never felt the shot and only discovered the damage three hours later.

""He was about 5 feet from me, but he hit my books,"" Derfuss said. ""I assumed I wasn't a target, I assumed I was fine. The truth is I was almost killed tonight and God intervened.""

""You never think something like this is going to happen to you until you have to react in that situation when someone is screaming there is a gun in the building. I ran for my life,"" said Allison Kope, a freshman from Cocoa Beach, Fla. ""I ran right out the back door. My laptop and everything is still in there. It was shock. It was just instinct. You don't think about anything else, you just go.""

The shooting started shortly around 12:30 a.m. ET. About 300 to 400 students were inside the campus' main library, which is open 24 hours on weekdays, when the shooter entered with a handgun and opened fire.

University President John Thrasher described the shootings as an isolated incident but also said police did ""an extraordinary job taking quick and decisive action to prevent further tragedy.""

Daniel Morales, a 19-year-old freshman from Fort Pierce, Fla., said that when he first heard someone say, "" 'Somebody's got a gun.' I thought he was joking."" But after realizing a gunman was in the library, Morales and others raced to a back room on the second floor where they barricaded a door with desks.

Three freshmen who were in the DeGraff Hall dormitory at the time said they began getting reports from friends locked down in the library.

""We know there are definitely people who saw the shooter,"" Anthony Coons said.

His friend Max Martin described the surreal scene.

""You hear all these stories on the news, then it happens,"" Martin said. ""This is something you never want to happen.""

Nikolai Hernandez, who was in another dorm room nearby, said he heard ""consecutive gunshots"" that sounded as if they came from an automatic rifle.

""That was confirmed when I went outside and talked to someone who said they saw police open fire on a shooter who was armed right on the front steps of the library,"" the freshman said.

The video below was posted on Facebook by Jessica Davis. An individual can be heard over the intercom saying ""There has been a shooting in the library. Stay where you are,"" and instructing people to call 911 if they have been shot.

Students were allowed to leave the library about 3 a.m. Before that, students were on lockdown at the campus' library and in dorms.

The shooting is being investigated as a homicide and attempted murder case, said Chief Michael DeLeo of the Tallahassee Police Department.

Florida State University police issued an alert warning its 40,000 students that read: ""Dangerous Situation! Main Campus — Tallahassee. Seek shelter immediately, away from doors and windows.""

""If there is any positive news we can take from this occurrence (it) is that the victim count was not higher,"" Tallahassee Mayor-elect Andrew Gillum said.

Social media immediately lit up with messages of concern and prayer requests.

Hmmm, let us explain.

According to an old Argentinian legend, the seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between is liable to turn into one of the mythical creatures.

Fear was so rife in the country that families would often give up their seventh-born sons for adoption or even kill them.

In the 1920s a law was passed to counteract the legend. It offered presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday but only for Catholic families.

868,"Our 2015 calendars are about to turn over to February and there's still no confirmed launched date for the Apple Watch. As a result, speculation on when the touchscreen wearable will hit shelves is beginning to reach a fervor. Fear not, however, as Ming-Chi Kuo, the analyst with a mostly reliable track record, is here to contribute to the prediction that the Apple Watch will begin shipping in March. Even more, Kuo says the much-discussed 12-inch MacBook Air will launch before the end of 2015's first quarter.

As an analyst for KGI Securities, Kuo's latest report says that before the Apple Watch's official release, Apple may announce additional details about the device (that's a big ""no duh""), including battery life specifics and when pre-orders will begin. He predicts that while components for the Apple Watch will see high shipments throughout the first quarter, initial production numbers will be low and a high customer demand will make the product hard to find. Kuo forecasts there will be 2.8 million Apple Watch shipments during the first quarter of 2015.

As for the new 12-inch MacBook Air, the analyst says the ultra-thin laptop will make its debut before the end of the current quarter, with additional information saying that Quanta Computer, an Apple supplier, has already begun increasing production. As a brand new entry to the MacBook Air line, the 12-inch model has long been suggested to feature a Retina display and an even thinner design, while recent rumors have pegged the notebook to ship with only a headphone jack and a single new reversible USB Type-C connector that will be used for charging.

A release date for the new MacBook Air within the current quarter definitely seems soon, but an alleged leak of the laptop's display only days ago could back up Kuo's claim of production having already begun. As for his prediction of a March release for the Apple Watch, that seems like a pretty safe bet, since Apple's own website says the device is ""coming early 2015."" We'll just have to wait to see if the wearable actually ships that month, of if that's just when pre-orders will begin.

881,"Hewlett-Packard is planning to split itself into two separate businesses, The Wall Street Journal is reporting.

Sources tell the WSJ that HP will split its personal-computer and printer segments from its corporate hardware and services business.

The announcement could come as early as Monday, the sources said.

The company reorganized itself in 2012 under CEO Meg Whitman. That move combined its computer and printer businesses.

The PC and computer segment is massive for HP. For the first six months this year, it reported $27.8 billion in revenue. That's about three times the size of HP's next biggest unit, the Enterprise Group, which makes servers, storage, and network hardware.

Under the new split, Whitman would be chairman of the computer and printer business, and CEO of a separate Enterprise Group, according to one of the sources. Patricia Russo, who sits on HP's board, would be chairman of the enterprise company. The printer and PC operation would be led by Dion Weisler, a current exec in that division.

Whitman has said since 2012 that fixing the supply chain is one of HP's biggest priorities to get the company back on track in terms of revenues and profits. HP reported a beat on revenue for its third quarter, and its profits were right in line.

This isn't the first time HP has been toying with the idea of strategic moves. For almost a year it has contemplated merging with EMC to create what would be one of the biggest enterprise companies in the world. But talks apparently fell through, The WSJ reported.

And HP isn't the only company that sees benefit in splitting itself to create a more-focused company. eBay announced last week that it was spinning off PayPal into a separate business starting next year.

HP declined to comment.

Since August, the terrorist group overtaking large swathes of Syria and Iraq, has beheaded two more Americans and a Briton in similar displays of barbarism.

The Islamic fundamentalist group, which has overrun large sections of Iraq and Syria, killing thousands of people in the process, had been financing its military by selling oil produced by the wells in the areas it has captured and by collecting ransom from the governments of its non-American hostages.

“They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,” the source told Buzzfeed. “They will not give the DNA without the money.”

The three men, identified as Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar, were taken into custody at the Rainbow Bridge Canadian/U.S. border crossing near Niagara Falls, according to WCVB.

Below, more on the missing soldiers from the AP:

Military officials said the Afghan soldiers had been participating in a U.S. Central Command Regional Cooperation training exercise at Joint Base Cape Cod. They arrived at Camp Edwards on Sept. 11 and were last seen Saturday at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis during an off day for the program.

The soldiers were reported missing by base security personnel Saturday night. They were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar.

It's not unusual for foreign military members to go missing when they are in the U.S. for training missions. Earlier this month, two Afghan police taking part in a training mission at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia disappeared. They were later found in Georgetown.

On Monday, Army Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said the 14 Afghans taking part in the Cape Cod military exercise were ""thoroughly vetted"" prior to coming to the U.S., so officials do not believe they are a threat.

The Regional Cooperation training exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation and interoperability among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.

894,"In a recent thread on Reddit, one Apple customer describes an experience in which he effected change in Apple's daily operations, specifically as it pertains to ""on hold"" music, after contacting CEO Tim Cook via email.

Since the days of Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executives have been famously open to customer suggestions, complaints and praise, often engaging with the public via work email accounts. As noted by TUAW, that tradition appears to carry on with current CEO Tim Cook.

According to one account shared on Reddit — in response to an earlier post on efforts taken by Apple's Maps team to correct erroneous address data — a customer was reportedly able to induce change in the quality of on hold music used by Apple's call center.

I once sent Tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with Apple. It was super low quality, therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because I was on hold for 20+ minutes for something so simple (iPhone didn't turn on, needed to set up a repair as in my country no Apple Store = have to send it to another country).

Much to my surprise a lady from Cupertino called me up the next day, saying she'd received a concerning email from Tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone, that Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done. She assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections.

The next time I called Apple, the hold music was indeed very pleasant.

Cook is known to be just as open to criticism . During an interview with NBC's Brian Williams in 2012, Cook admitted he routinely receives hundreds of emails from customers every day.

""I get hundreds, and some days thousands of emails from customers. This is a privilege because they talk to you as if you're sitting at their kitchen table,"" Cook said at the time. ""Because they care so deeply about Apple, they want to make a suggestion, or want to ask for help on something, or want to tell you how much they love the product."""

A jealous wife in China chopped off her cheating husband’s penis as he slept, then snuck into his hospital room after he had it sewn back on — and hacked it off again and tossed it out the window.

Fan Lung, a dad of five, sealed his fate when he decided to use his wife’s cellphone to send his secret lover a hot and heavy email, Central European News reports.

The 32-year-old forgot to log out of his account after the message was sent, which is how his 21-year-old wife, Feng — who is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm — came across the saucy exchange and snapped.

The jilted wife went berserk, grabbed a pair of scissors, stormed into their bedroom and cut off his penis while he was sleeping.

Lung was rushed to the hospital, where doctors were able to save the appendage and sew it back on.

But Feng was able to sneak into the recovery room, where she chopped his penis off a second time and threw it out the window, according to CEN.

A shocked Lung chased his wife outside, despite losing a lot of blood.

“Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman,” a hospital spokesman said. “He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.”

Despite desperate search efforts, authorities were unable to find Lung’s manhood. Police believe it may have been stumbled upon by a stray dog or cat, according to CEN.

Lung’s side chick — Zhang Hung, 21 — said she’s OK with her man not being able to have more children.

“It doesn’t matter that he’s lost his fertility,” she told CEN. “He has five children already.”"
904,"(Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co plans to break in two, separating its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

The company plans to announce the move as early as Monday, the Journal said in a report on its web site that cited people familiar with the matter. The division would be made through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year, according to the report.

910,"The ring little Aiden brought to school may not have been the true ring of power, but it had enough controversy to get him suspended from a Kermit, Texas, school.

Tolkien lore led a Texas boy to suspension after he brought his “one ring” to school.

Kermit Elementary School officials called it a threat when the 9-year-old boy, Aiden Steward, in a playful act of make-believe, told a classmate he could make him disappear with a ring forged in fictional Middle Earth’s Mount Doom.

“It sounded unbelievable,” the boy’s father, Jason Steward, told the Daily News. He insists his son “didn’t mean anything by it.”

The Stewards had just watched “The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies” days earlier, inspiring Aiden’s imagination and leading him to proclaim that he had in his possession the one ring to rule them all.

“Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly,” Steward said.

Aiden claimed Thursday he could put a ring on his friend's head and make him invisible like Bilbo Baggins, who stole Gollum’s ""precious"" in J.R.R. Tolkien’s fantasy series “The Lord of the Rings.”

“I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence,” the boy's father later wrote in an email. ""If he did, I'm sure he'd bring him right back.""

Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the fourth-grader’s suspension, citing confidentiality policies, according to the Odessa American, who first reported Aiden’s troubles Friday.

The family moved to the Kermit Independent School District only six months ago, but it’s been nothing but headaches for Aiden. He’s already been suspended three times this school year.

Two of the disciplinary actions this year were in-school suspensions for referring to a classmate as black and bringing his favorite book to school: ""The Big Book of Knowledge.""

“He loves that book. They were studying the solar system and he took it to school. He thought his teacher would be impressed,” Steward said.

But the teacher learned the popular children’s encyclopedia had a section on pregnancy, depicting a pregnant woman in an illustration, he explained.

911,"When you’re a company the size of Apple (whose co-founder Steve Jobs famously made comments about how it’s not the job of users to know what they want) you’d be forgiven for thinking they don’t listen to the little guy.

Over the weekend, a story popped up on Reddit, however, revealing how one user supposedly convinced Tim Cook to change Apple’s on-hold music — telling him that it sounded distorted and therefore surprisingly un-Apple-like in its lack of quality. Cook apparently listened and – hey presto! – people dialling into Apple now get better-sounding hold music while they wait.

The full post can be read below:

“I once sent Tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with Apple. It was super low quality, therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because I was on hold for 20+ minutes for something so simple (iPhone didn’t turn on, needed to set up a repair as in my country no Apple Store = have to send it to another country).

Much to my surprise a lady from Cupertino called me up the next day, saying she’d received a concerning email from Tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone, that Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done. She assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections.

The next time I called Apple, the hold music was indeed very pleasant.”

Like Steve Jobs, Tim Cook’s email ((sorry, you need Javascript to see this e-mail address)) is public and there are multiple stories of him responding to those who email him. During his 2013 address at Auburn University, Cook commented that: “I receive hundreds of e-mails from customers every day, and I read them all.”

Apparently he has quite the efficient (team of?) personal assistant(s) to turn that reading into actions, as well.

912,"At CES 2015 event scheduled between Jan. 6 and Jan. 9, a potential company named Standzout will be showcasing its prototype of the Apple Watch accessory. The accessory in focus is the ""Bandstand Apple Watch dock."" The aforesaid company calls it the first great Apple Watch accessory ever.

The dock apparently makes use of an ""induction charging plate to power the gadget"" and by doing so, it holds the smartwatch in place. In addition, there are two USB ports housed on the device to enable the user to charge other devices like Apple iPhones and iPads, notes Phone Arena. Interested readers can check out the Bandstand Apple Watch dock prototype from Gigaom.

When it comes to Apple Watch release date, reports state that the Cupertino-headquartered company might launch its gadget on Valentine's Day. Meanwhile, the sales predictions for the Apple Watch are as high as 30 million units and the demand is assumed to grow further, according to the same site. In contrast to other smartwatches available in the market, Apple will reportedly be marketing the Watch as a fashion accessory than a tech gear.

When it comes to key features of the Apple Watch, the company is believed to be working on two different models, namely 38 mm and 42 mm versions of the smartwatch. Moreover, the gadget with high focus on fashion will be offered in six different casing options. In addition, the smartwatch's band can reportedly be interchanged as required. As far as the pricing details go, the base variant of the Apple Watch i.e. the sports model will reportedly be priced at $349. But then, the high-end variants especially the solid gold/diamond model will go as high as several thousand dollars, says MacRumors.

Moving on to the higher-end Apple Watch, Apple is planning to release a $30,150 priced model of the smartwatch, adorned in diamonds and sapphire. The sapphire and diamond-clad gadget will reportedly come with eight rows of ""high-grade 15 carat diamonds"" and it is considered to be the ""luxury edition"" of the smartwatch. Apparently, this device will also come equipped with sapphire glass display for extra protection, notes Phone Arena."
914,"Nope. Argentina’s President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has not become godmother of a Jewish baby to stop him from becoming a werewolf – despite what you may have read in multiple news reports.

Over the past few days, the story has been reported and unquestioningly re-reported across the echo chamber of the internet, picked up by news organisations around the world including Haaretz, Buzzfeed, The Independent and The Huffington Post.

Like all good urban myths, the articles were based on a grain of truth: by tradition, the seventh son (or daughter) born to an Argentine family is eligible to become the godson (or daughter) of the president. Until this month, the honour had only been bestowed on Christian babies, but on Wednesday, Iair Tawil – not a baby, but the strapping 21-year old son of a rabbi – became the country’s first Jewish presidential godson.

In her Twitter account, Kirchner described Tawil, 21, as “completely sweet” and lit Hanukkah candles with his family.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

But somehow, the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón (Argentina’s equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.

Evidently, the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colourful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible – confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behaviour from national leaders in the continent of magical realism.

But according to Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda, there is no link between the two traditions. “The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,” he said.

That custom began in 1907, when Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann, Volga German emigrés from south-eastern Russia asked then-president José Figueroa Alcorta to become godfather to their seventh son, said the historian.

“The couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia, where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons, and Argentina’s president accepted.”

The practice soon became tradition and was passed into law in 1974 by Isabel Perón, the widow of Argentina’s political strongman General Juan Perón, once she succeeded him in the presidential seat after his death in office. As Argentina’s first woman president, Mrs Perón extended the benefit to seventh daughters as well.“The unconnected myth of the lobizón began among Argentina’s “gauchos,” the cowboys of Argentina’s vast cattle-raising Pampas, adapted from the older European werewolf legends,” said Balmaceda.In the Argentinian version, the lobizón transforms into a mixture of pig and dog every Tuesday and Friday night – not just once every full moon. Unlikely other werewolves of myth, the lobizón transmits its curse not through its bite but by passing between the legs of its unfortunate victims.

In Catholic Argentina, large familes are not uncommon: over 120,000 families had seven of more children at last count in 2006. Not all qualify to become presidential god-children as the honour is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively, with no daughters in between.

The president with most godsons was Juan Perón, who had 1,982 over three terms in office. He is followed by another Peronist former president, Carlos Menem, who had 1,136 during the 1990s. Fernández has become presidential godmother to some 700 children since taking office in 2007. Earlier this year, she set another precedent, by making the the daughter of a lesbian couple the first presidential godchild."
916,"The giant Samauma tree that is thought to be over 5,800 years old judging on its concentric rings and estimated to be close to 40 meters in height was a major part of the native tribes cultural landscape, countless generations of natives having witnessed the long duration of the tree and having included it in their own culture.

«It is the Mother spirit of the rainforest, from this spirit-tree came the life force of all things living. They have destroyed Aotlcp-Awak, they have brought darkness upon not only our people, but the whole world» explains local tribesman leader Tahuactep of the Matsés tribe.

Native communities alarmed local media outlets and conservation groups when Aotlcp-Awak, or Mother tree in local dialects, was reported sawed down by heavy machinery

Anna Golding, local researcher for non profit organization and conservancy group Rainforest Protection Coalition (RPC), an initiative stemming from Berkeley University in California, believes the ‘incident’ was intentionnal. « There are large portions of this national reserve that are rich in oil and natural gas. There has been committed action by energy corporations to lobby the government to exploit the area for years. The protected zones have been cut in half over the past decade and this is only their latest attempt to get rid of the local populations who are fighting to preserve their cultural heritage and lifestyle» she admits.

Between 1991 and 2014, the total area of forest lost in the Amazon has more than tripled, with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle.

918,"Mittens the cat has both male and female genitalia.

The Canadian kitty, who lives with its owner in Heart's Desire, Newfoundland, will need surgery to cure its bowel and urinary problems as a result of its dual gender, CBC reports.

Colleen Clarke-Murphy took Mittens in when her daughter brought it home, thinking it was a stray. In October, Mittens was rushed to a vet, who gave the surprising news. Clarke-Murphy said her first response was, ""Did I just hear you right?""

Since gender assignment surgery is more a medical need than a cosmetic one, the initial question was, which gender should Mittens be?

Clarke-Murphy said she'd rather have a female cat, but she'll follow the veterinarian's recommendation to make Mittens a male.

""They're the ones who know what they're doing. I mean, I really don't know. I'd like for it to be a female, but it really don't matter. It's got both parts,"" she said. ""I think it's got both personalities, so it really don't matter.""

Mittens will need to be both spayed and neutered before the $1,500 reconstructive surgery. Good luck, Mittens!

Cats with two genders may be uncommon, but they're not unheard of, Liverpool Echo reports. Late last year, a couple in Liverpool was shocked to find that their little white princess, Twinkle, was also a little white prince.

Twinkle's vet recommended that the male parts be removed, and made it so. The feline is reportedly doing well -- alongside her brother Socks -- after her gender assignment surgery.

923,"President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchhner adopted Yair Tawil as her godson, due to an Argentine folktale that says the seventh born son in a family will turn into a werewolf, and eat unbaptized babies.

Argentina's president has adopted a young Jewish boy as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.

Yair Tawil was adopted in a ceremony which took place because of Argentinian folklore, reports the Independent.

He is the first Jewish boy to be adopted, as the practice only applied to Catholics until 2009.

According to tradition in the country, the seventh son born to a family turns into a werewolf, a feared ""el lobison"".

The creature only shows its true nature on the first Friday after the boy's 13th birthday, turning the teenager into a demon at midnight during every full moon.

Legend has it that the lobison feeds on unbaptized babies.

Although the story may now seem fanciful, fear of the werewolf-like creature was so widespread in 19th century Argentina that some families even murdered their babies.

To stop the practice happening the Argentine president began adopting babies.

Any family now which has seven sons or daughters get the president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship, reports the Independent.

President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchhner described the adoption as a ""magical moment"" and called the Tawils a ""marvelous family""."
925,"The tubby dictator has become hooked on Emmental - and appeared on TV with a swollen face and a limp at a recent ­ceremony in the capital Pyongyang

Portly despot Kim Jong-un is absolutely crackers – about Swiss cheese.

The tubby North Korean dictator has become hooked on Emmental and has gorged on so much that he has ballooned in size and is now walking with a limp.

The 31-year-old fell in love with the holey treat when he was a student in Switzerland.

He now imports it for his own consumption, while millions of his citizens starve.

A gloomy Jong-un appeared on TV with a swollen face and a limp at a recent ­ceremony in the capital Pyongyang to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of the nation’s founder Kim Il-sung.

It prompted dissidents who have fled the closed nation to reveal he is in poor health due to his increasing weight.

They believe Jong-un stuffs himself to look like his grandfather.

Defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, said: “North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny.

""There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung.”

Jong-un even sent envoys to France to try and enrol North Korean cooks on cheese making courses.

The director of National Dairy Industry College, Veronique Drouet, said the Korean request was politely but firmly declined.

An American was arrested by South Korean marines as he tried to swim up a river into North Korea. The man, in his 20s or 30s, was found clinging to the bank suffering from exhaustion.

929,"(WASHINGTON, DC) – In the boldest takeover of Presidential authority in history, Barack Obama ordered the Federal Reserve to adopt the euro beginning October 1, 2015, the start of the next fiscal year. The US will soon share the single monetary system used by 18 European Union member states, including Greece, France, Germany, and Slovakia.

The surprise announcement resulted from secret overseas deals between Obama, foreign finance ministers and the Federal Reserve System. “This step forward,” announced Obama, “will make it easier for Americans and Wall Street to compare prices, stabilize the economy, and set us up to again become leaders on the world economic stage.” The President revealed the changeover during the worldwide economic summit held in Beijing, where alongside Chinese premier Li Keqiang, he worked out a climate accord agreement, also developed in secrecy.

Criticism has been swift and severe. “Obama’s given up entirely on our US economy after single-handedly destroying it,” said Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX 8th District), Chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.

“It’s like breaking all the toys in the toybox and then saying I don’t want to play with those broken products anymore,” said former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. “This is the most abusive power grab witnessed on the worldwide stage. He needs to consider staying over in China while he’s there,” she added.

To help with the conversion to the euro, a new whitehouse.gov website will launch in early 2015, complete with downloadable conversion calculators and apps. Printable vouchers will be provided for discounts toward government manufactured cash registers. A children’s website featuring ‘Yuri the Happy Euro‘ will help prepare youngsters for the new system.

For the first 3 months of the conversion, euro notes and coins will circulate jointly with US currency, owing to overlap with the 2015 holiday season. “We don’t want to add any extra stress to an already hectic time of year,” said the President. “My economic team predicts everything will go smoothly, and holiday shopping should be stronger than ever.”

Many unanswered questions remain. Will vendors take advantage of the new system to gouge consumers? What about ATMs? Will small businesses who can’t afford to make the changeover right away close up shop and further weaken an increasingly unstable Obama economy?

“I think it’s a good idea, said Washington DC shop owner Vonda Miller. “I spend too much time counting pennies all day long making change. They tell me my taxes will be easier to do, so I’m for whatever the President wants.”

934,"Bears might be the #1 threat to America, but what’s the #1 threat to bears? Justin Bieber, apparently.

Here’s the deal: Russian fisherman Igor Vorozhbitsyn was on his way to his favorite fishing spot in Russia’s Yakutia Republic on August 5 when he was attacked by a brown bear. Just then, the 42-year-old’s ringtone, which was set to Bieber’s “Baby,” started blasting, and the ursine predator fled into the woods.

“Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,” a wildlife expert told the Austrian Times.

OK, so the next time I’m attacked by bears, I’ve gotta play some Justin Bieber. But the next time I’m attacked by pirates, I’ve gotta crank that Britney Spears. Got it.

Thanks to JB’s breakout 2010 single, Vorozhbitsyn survived with only cuts and severe bruises to his face and chest, although I don’t think the ordeal has made him a Belieber. “I know that sort of ringtone isn’t to everyone’s taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,” he told the AT. Yep, that story definitely checks out."
937,"Murderous cult figurehead Charles Manson, now 80 and in prison for life, received a marriage license back in November so that he could tie the knot with Afton ""Star"" Elaine Burton, 26, who comes off in interviews like another crazed admirer. She might be more than that, though: their license has lapsed without a wedding, and one journalist claims it's because Manson got wise to Star's alleged plan to acquire his corpse and put it on public display for money. Holy shit, really? Here's what we know.

Daniel Simone, who's working on a book about Manson, told Page Six that Star Burton and her associate, Craig ""Gray Wolf"" Hammond, have been scheming for two years to open a Lenin's Tomb-style attraction in California, with the madman's body on view in a glass case.

When the two asked Manson to sign his body over to them, Simone says, he wouldn't give a definitive answer. He just led them on so they'd keep bringing him ""toiletries and other items"" in prison. The marriage plot was the next step, according to Simone, an attempt to ensure Star would get Manson's remains after his death.

""There's certain things next of kin can do,"" she told the AP last November, saying she wanted to work on Manson's case and the marriage would give her access to confidential information. She didn't mention the body.

And now Manson has let their 90-day marriage certificate lapse.

""He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool,"" Simone claims, adding that Manson thinks Burton's plan for his body is stupid because ""he feels he will never die."" Now Manson allegedly doesn't want to get married at all.

That's not what Burton and Hammond's website claims, though: They say Manson plans to renew the license, and the wedding was only postponed ""due to an unexpected interruption in logistics.""

But who's playing whom, here? Back in 2013, when Burton first announced her engagement to Manson in Rolling Stone, Manson dismissed her:

He snorts. ""Oh, that,"" he says. ""That's a bunch of garbage. You know that, man. That's trash. We're just playing that for public consumption.""
Manson also called ""Star"" his ""baby on the floor,"" implying that he was manipulating her like he did the other women in his murderous Family. Like them, she shaved her head and carved an x into her forehead at his request.

""We started all over with this one. The other ones know it all now. I don't need to say anything.""

He doesn't come off like the one being ""played for a fool"" in that scenario. And Burton's claim that Manson thinks he can never die doesn't square with what Manson himself told Rolling Stone contributor Eric Hedegaard back in 2013: ""What do you think? Do you think this story will help me get out of here, only for a little while, before I go?""

Burton wouldn't necessarily need Manson's corpse to make money, either: His son said last year that Manson's made a six-figure fortune selling art and memorabilia, which Star would stand to inherit. He also claimed she and Grey Wolf planned to sell the wedding photos for as much as $150,000.

So, is the ""glass case"" story bullshit? Hard to say, because it's not supported by direct quotes from Burton, who wouldn't comment to Page Six, or Manson, who lost his phone privileges years ago, and whose current whereabouts and medical condition the prison system won't reveal.

And even if they were talking, one is an unreliable, allegedly manipulative crazy person, and the other is Charles Manson."

The report comes from long-time Silicon Valley journalist Robert X. Cringely, who recently published an eBook on IBM's issues entitled The Decline and Fall of IBM. He blamed past CEOs Louis Gerstner and Sam Palmisano for making the mess and current CEO Virginia Rometty has done nothing to address them.

The problem is a complex mess of bad management – like laying off important people in the middle of a project – to getting sidetracked with pie-in-the-sky ideas like commercializing Watson and failing to adjust to the new era. The ""M"" in IBM may mean machines, but hardware is less than 10% of its business. Two-thirds is in services, and the services pipeline has dried up.

Why? Well, according to an ex-IBMer I spoke to some time ago, who confirmed what Cringely wrote in his book, IBM is still wedded to services contracts in an age where companies are shutting down their internal data center entirely and moving everything to the cloud. If you don't have a data center, you don't need an IBM service contract to manage it.


That's why IBM grabbed Softlayer, the cloud services provider. It needed to get into the cloud fast because it was behind Microsoft, Google and Amazon. Since the purchase 18 months ago, IBM has put a huge amount of money into SoftLayer and there has been a number of announcements around SoftLayer services.

Cringely said the mainframe and storage areas will see deep cuts, which is pretty stupid considering IBM announced the new Z13 mainframe and hopes it will stimulate sales. That won't be easy when you cut the people who are supposed to sell it. Cutting storage is also foolish, as we are in the era of Big Data and Data Lakes and storage is vital to these concepts.

And you have to wonder what a layoff of 110,000 people will do to the firm. That has to be jarring. I remember an old advertisement from the print days that said ""What's worse, getting laid off on a Friday or being told to pick up the slack on the following Monday?"" This will be undeniably upsetting to the survivors, who will likely spend time updating their LinkedIn profiles.

The question I have to ask is why isn't Rometty one of the 110k. IBM has seen 11 straight quarters of declining revenue and it's hemorrhaging customers, according to both my source and Cringely. It's becoming apparent she is not up for the job and can't pull the company out of its nose dive.

Cringely said the layoffs will begin next week and by the end of February, all of the employees will be gone. If nothing else, IBM's first quarter numbers will take a monstrous hit from the severance packages for 111,000 employees. To say nothing of what this will do to its customer confidence."
946,"Last night, Pando’s Michael Carney cited a well-placed source who claims that Apple is on the verge of buying flailing social network, Path. Today, on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, Path founder Dave Morin was asked about the report.

Morin’s response was straight from the Dummies Guide To Media Training: “We don’t comment on rumors or speculation.” When TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino pointed out “that’s not a no,” Morin repeated his response.

There are a couple of things to note here. For one thing, from a PR point of view, Morin’s response was exactly right. If the deal is about to happen, then he’s hardly going to confirm it on stage to a reporter ahead of time. If the deal isn’t about to happen, Morin can still benefit from the idea that Path is still valuable to someone.

And yet, it’s interesting how Morin’s “no comment” flies in the face of a promise he made to Pando’s Sarah Lacy last year about how he and Path would deal with the press in future. As Sarah explained at the time:

I explained the problem from the journalists’ side, and asked Morin what he proposed for a publication and entrepreneurs who want to start having a fairer dialog. Not a favorable one, but a fair one. Something that helps readers more than the denial, the reporter speculation, and the rewritten press release. He said for his part he was no longer going to obfuscate anything. If a reporter gets a scoop, and it’s accurate and he or she calls him up, he’ll say congratulations and tell them to run with it. No more playing games.

Given Morin’s response on stage today, and the fact Carney contacted him last night for comment but received no response, perhaps a more accurate promise would have been “No more playing games, unless I’m scared shitless of upsetting Apple.”"
953,"(Sept. 22, 2014, update 1:09 p.m.) A high-ranking source tells the Cape Cod Times that the three Afghan soldiers who were reported missing after leaving a training exercise at Camp Edwards on Cape Cod have been located at the Canadian border, apparently seeking asylum.

The source has been briefed on the issue, but could not be quoted on the record because he was not authorized to speak.

U.S. Central Command could not immediately confirm the information.

The Afghan soldiers went missing Saturday at Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis.

Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady said the three men were reported missing on Saturday night after travelling into Hyannis that day.

“They didn't report back (to the base),” Sahady said. “There is no indication they pose a threat to the public.”

Police and base officials were cooperating in the search for the three men, identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada, and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar. Sahady didn't have any descriptions or ages for the three officers.

A state police spokesman said they are not involved in the investigation.

There are 200 soldiers and civilians participating in the seven day event at Camp Edwards on Joint Base Cape Cod. Along with 12 other members of the Afghanistan National Army, the three men were all engaged in the joint exercise that focused on working on collaboration and tactical strategies that involved civilians and officers and senior enlisted personnel, Sahady said. There were six nations, including the U.S. participating in the exercise which is ongoing and is scheduled to wrap up by Wednesday. They were housed on the base and all participants at the exercise were all vetted by U.S. Central Command, Sahady said.

U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Jon Custis of the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., who organized the training exercise, did not return a call Sunday seeking comment.

“They had the freedom to come and go,” Sahady said. “If they were off-duty, they could go to McDonald's or the mall.”

The three arrived in the country on Sept. 11, Sahady said. Saturday was a free day. They were last spotted Saturday night at the Cape Cod Mall, Sahady said.

Apple Watch is the Cupertino-based company’s first ever endeavor into the wearable market, and as is the case with all Apple devices, this little hand-worn gadget will not settle for being just another trendy smartwatch, with the company looking to create a new luxury niche for its loyal, or potentially new line of wealthy consumers. To be launched in three variants; Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport, and Apple Watch Edition, it is the third variant that happens to be expensive enough for the company to consider employing jewelry store-styled security protocols to protect it.

Apple-Watch-Edition-main

With 18-karat of gold on the Apple Watch Edition, 9to5Mac is reporting that the Cupertino company is bolstering up its security across all its stores and has begun placing safes coupled with MagSafe chargers in outlets that would sell the wearable in the future. More so, the stores will also be using scales to weigh the watches upon return to ascertain that no gold has been removed from the device. Apple Stores have had their share of experiences with robberies before, and the company is not willing to take a chance this time around, with all the demo units and Watch Edition stock to be placed in these safes.

All this talk about scales being used for processing any returned Apple Watch Edition may not tell us just how much gold would Apple’s luxury wearable be actually carrying for now, but we can guess there’s plenty to be removed to cause a significant decrease in weight to show up on a precision weighing scale. This is where you can draw a conclusion that the particular version of Apple’s smartwatch could in fact be worth thousands of dollars.

Meanwhile, Tim Cook has already announced that the company’s ""most personal device ever"", will begin shipping out this April. We already know that the Apple Watch – the entrant version – will cost $349, but the company has remained silent on the Watch Edition.

Bart’s owner, Tampa Bay resident Ellis Hutson, buried Bart back on January 15th after a neighbor found him dead in the road in a pool of his own blood after being hit by a car. Five days later, however, Bart turned up at a nearby store looking for food — although it’s unclear if he just wanted some Fancy Feast or HUMAN SOULS.

Fox 13 reports:

Bart is at the Human Society of Tampa Bay right now, and rescuers told FOX 13 that he has severe trauma to the head, a broken jaw, a dead eye, and other injuries. Right now, doctors are scheduling surgery to save its life.

FOX 13 visited Bart on Monday. Rescuers say they believe he may have regained consciousness, dug himself out of the ground, and hid for a few days.

I don’t know about you guys, but personally I like my Florida stories when they aren’t literally the plot of a Stephen King novel. Bart is expected to make a full recovery, but as if you needed more reason to stay away from Florida, there is now a zombie cat on the loose. What you choose to do with that information is entirely up to you."

IBM is reportedly planning its largest corporate layoff ever - cutting 111,800 of its staff.

A report by a respected Silicon Valley journalist for Forbes said around 26% of the company's 430,000-strong workforce would be cut this week.

The previous largest corporate redundancy was also carried out by IBM, when it cut 60,000 staff in 1993.

The company's reorganisation is codenamed Project Chrome, and most of the staff being laid off are in the US.

It will pave the way for IBM to focus on cloud computing, it is claimed, rather than its traditional hardware business.

Reporter Robert X Cringely wrote: ""To fix its business problems and speed up its 'transformation', next week about 26% of IBM's employees will be getting phone calls from their managers.

""A few hours later a package will appear on their doorsteps with all the paperwork.""

However, some technology commentators have said they are sceptical about the size of the reported cuts.

In a statement to Sky News, an IBM spokeswoman said the rumour was ""ridiculous"" and ""baseless"".

She said: ""If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing.

""This equates to several thousand people, a mere fraction of what's been reported.

""Last year, IBM hired 45,000 people, and the company currently has about 15,000 job openings around the world for new skills in growth areas such as cloud, analytics, security, and social and mobile technologies.

""This is evidence that IBM continues to remix its skills to match where we see the best opportunities in the marketplace.

IBM was founded in 1911 and adopted the name International Business Machines in 1924.

It currently creates hardware and software, and provides infrastructure, hosting and consulting services.

It has revenue of around $90bn (£60bn) and is one of the most profitable companies in the US."
994,"A new TV show in Peru has captured the moment unwitting men have been caught wolf-whistling their own mothers.

The experiment took two mothers, whose sons were identified as repeat cat-callers, and disguised them using make-up, wigs and clothes. The women then women walked past their sons to gauge their reaction.

The mother wearing a disguise of a wig and sunglasses walks past her unsuspecting son and a friend, before he makes a comment towards her

The mother then goes over to confront her child, who is still unaware the woman is actually his parent

The man acts in horror as he realises it is his own mother and she launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty

The mother gets so angry with her son, she then takes off her bag and proceeds to hit him with it due to this behaviour

In the first case, the mother is dressed in a short black dress and walks past her son and a friend in the street.

The son then unwittingly makes a comment at his mother saying 'tasty panties' which prompts her to go and confront him.

She then removes her sunglasses and the man then realises he has just cat-called his own mother.

The mother then launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty and saying she never taught him to talk to women in that manner.

Another mother, wearing a black wig walks past her son, who is standing working on the streets of Lima

After making a remark towards his mother, she then turns around and goes over to confront him

She then takes off her wig to reveal herself and then throws it on the floor in anger after being disgusted by her son's behaviour

The mother then tells her son he should be ashamed of himself for speaking to her like that, as he pleads with her to calm down

She then gets so angry with her child that she then removes her bag and hits him with it.

Meanwhile in the second case, the mother wearing a green dress, walks past her son, who calls her 'piggy'.

She then calls his name before taking off her wig and confronting her son, hitting him with her hairpiece.

The man then tries to claim he didn't make the remark but is then forced to apologise to his mother before she walks off

She too launches into a tirade telling her son to he should be ashamed of himself, while he pleads with his mother to quieten down as he is working.

He then tries to claim he didn't make the remark and it a man in a nearby car, but he eventually apologises before his mother walks off.

The video ends with a warning saying men should start respecting women before they unwittingly harass their own mothers.

It comes after the video claims that seven in 10 women say they have experienced sexual harassment on the streets of the Peruvian capital Lima."

998,"An astonishing image appears to show a giant crab, nearly 50 feet across, lurking in the harbor at Whitstable, Kent, and while some assert that it is a playful hoax, others believe they have found evidence of a genuine aquatic monster.

The aerial image reveals the outline of a crab at the mouth of Kent harbor, yet the size of the animal dwarfs fishing boats on a nearby pier, as the Daily Mail notes. The giant animal is shaped like an edible crab, a species commonly found in British waters, but which only grows to be ten inches across, on average.

People have flocked to the website Weird Whitstable since the image was first posted there, to judge its authenticity for themselves. Quinton Winter, who curates Weird Whitstable, asserted that the image of the giant crab was sent to him by a follower. At first, he believed that it showed only an unusually shaped sand formation, though he is now convinced that there truly is a strange animal lurking in the harbor.

While crabbing with his son in Whitstable harbor last year, Winter claims to have spotted the giant crab near shore, as he related to The Daily Express.

Save yourselves, Crabzilla has arrived in Whitstable http://t.co/W2NgcmJP24 pic.twitter.com/7RuUxSBUhB

— Sara Nelson (@SaraCNelson) October 13, 2014

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood,’ Winter said. “It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws… Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

In July of last year, another image emerged, depicting a giant crab lurking underneath a pier.

Another image, said to be taken in July of last year and posted on Winter’s Weird Whitstablog, purports to show a giant, albeit smaller, crab hiding under a pier.

“This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend,” claims Winter’s website, adding “The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passersby shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water, into the dark, sideways.”

Graphic artist Ashley Austen noted his skepticism of the aerial image while speaking to Kent Online, describing the way in which such a photograph could be easily manufactured.

“The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop,” he said. “All the ‘artist’ had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbor and apply a few filters to it to get the realistic look.”

Earlier this year, another photograph of an unknown creature emerged from England, appearing to show “Bownessie,” an animal similar to the Loch Ness Monster. As The Inquisitr noted at the time, the surprisingly clear image was met with claims that it had been similarly created in Photoshop.

The largest known species of crustacean is the Japanese Spider Crab. Giant in comparison to other known species of crab, adults can grow to be 12 feet across.

1030,"BUTTE — Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington is a wanted man in these parts. Too bad neither the position nor the man exist.

A satirical story about Rob O’Neill posted on the Internet has prompted everyone from Associated Press reporters to Louisiana law enforcement officers to call local authorities for information.

Empire News posted a bogus article Monday titled “Bin Laden Shooter Rob O’Neill Mistakenly Attacked by Street Thugs Seeking To Collect Debt From Neighbor.”

“Nothing in the story has a resemblance of truth,” Butte-Silver Bow Undersheriff George Skuletich said Wednesday.

Skuletich does exist, for the record.

What is fabricated in the article includes: the police commissioner, five gang members seeking a drug debt and the Butte Daily Times. Also, O’Neill did not take down the intruders and brew a pot of coffee while awaiting backup.

“We’ve been getting all kinds of calls from across the country,” Sheriff Ed Lester said.

The article has been making its rounds on social media sites. This prompted Snopes.com to label it false.

“Empire News is one of many fake news sites responsible for the frequent hoodwinking of Facebook users. Among previous hoaxes were a yarn about welfare recipients getting free cars, a claim that Colorado legalized meth and a widely shared story about pending ‘snowmageddon,’” Snopes notes.

The piece claims that members of the Crips gang broke into the home of the former Navy SEAL and Butte native.

“We don’t have established Bloods or Crips here,” Lester added.

The story goes: “As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. O’Neill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. O’Neill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!”

While some might find the fake news piece amusing, local police are reminded of another hoax of a girl who reportedly shot intruders: An 11-year-old Butte girl was reported to have taken out two crooks. She was reportedly a clay-shooting champion in Butte who killed one man with a shot to the genitals and the other bled out.

That bogus story reappears about every year or so, Lester said."
1033,"Raven-Symone did NOT file molestation charges against Bill Cosby. A hoax report that has gone viral amid renewed rape allegations against Cosby claims the former child star “revealed to the TMZ offices that she too had been raped and drugged” by Cosby following the final episode of “The Cosby Show.” The story is 100 percent false and fake.

The actress herself took to Instagram on Wednesday to shoot down the story: “I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of! Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!”

TMZ has nothing to do with the original phony story. It was started by something called Hip Hop Hangover, an unfunny parody site, and then shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook. Large outlets like the Indian version of International Business Times picked it up and treated the fake allegations like they were real.

The post contains phony quotes from a purported lawyer for Raven-Symone, including a fake press announcement that declares, “We among so many others are tired of the media worshipping and praising a man that has a past so terrible that it is unbelievable. My client (Raven-Symone) is also ready to tell her side of the story. A side that was kept quiet because of threats from being blackballed.” No actual lawyer for the real Raven-Symone ever made such a statement.

Again, Raven-Symone has NOT actually claimed Cosby molested or raped her. The article is a hoax timed to exploit the very serious allegations against Cosby by women including Janice Dickinson and Joan Tarshis. It’s appalling that outlets would spread this “satirical” story about Raven-Symone without checking first."

According to the new enforcements, males and females will be separated aboard the airlines' flights unless they are closely related."
1044,"After deploying tear gas to break up pro-democracy demonstrators, police in Hong Kong warned late Sunday local time that they will use “a higher level of force” against the crowds of thousands if “public order” is not restored.

Demonstrators have gathered outside government headquarters near the city’s financial district calling for the Chinese government to grant democratic reforms in Hong Kong. An overwhelming amount of protesters were seen mimicking the symbolic “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture used throughout protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the killing of unarmed teen Michael Brown.

Students – many of whom have already boycotted a week of classes – and activists began camping out on Friday, and were later joined by members of a civil disobedience movement known as Occupy Central.



Protesters told the Associated Press that the demonstrations were peaceful when riot police started to use pepper spray and launch tear gas canisters. That sent coughing protesters running in all directions, but many later reconvened vowing to keep the rally going. Police officers were wearing both helmets and respirators to protect them from the gas.

Government leaders in Hong Kong and Beijing called the demonstrations “unlawful” and “illegal” respectively, but many protesters say they will not waver.

“If today I don’t stand out, I will hate myself in future,” taxi driver Edward Yeung told Reuters. “Even if I get a criminal record,” he said, “it will be a glorious one.”

Hong Kong does have some some autonomy from Beijing which took over sovereignty of the former British colony in 1997.

But Beijing has asserted more control in the city in recent months. This includes requiring Beijing’s approval of election candidates and allegations of intimidation from mainland officials on free business practices in Hong Kong, according to The Washington Post. Occupy Central vowed to protest the Chinese government’s actions back in June when the city’s Beijing-backed leader said a trio of reforms the group was suggesting failed to comply with existing laws, The New York Times reported.

Beijing has promised Hong Kong a free election to choose its leader by 2017, but pro-democracy supporters there and Chinese officials on the mainland have so far failed to agree on guidelines for such a vote.

Government officials in Hong Kong warned that the continued demonstrations may disrupt public transport in the financial hub on Monday, Reuters reported. Police have not used tear gas in Hong Kong in nearly a decade, according to NBC News. The tactic was last used in 2005 during World Trade Organization protests.

“We will fight until the end,” one protester told NBC News. “We will never give up.” Another protester – a student named Alexandra Wong – said, “We will not just say yes to whatever they do. We will fight for our rights, and fight for our democracy.”"

1052,"Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says militants were killed in Al-Bukamal

Isis militants have reportedly publicly executed at least two of their own fighters in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal, on charges of spying and embezzlement.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the first militant was executed for “banditry and robbing Muslims’ money”. The second militant was allegedly killed for “dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen”.

The electronic chips are understood to be a reference to electronic chips used for geo-location of targets in air strikes.

There are unconfirmed reports that the men were beheaded, although Isis (also known as Islamic State) have also been known to crucify people.

Charlie Winter, Programs Officer at counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said reports of Isis executing their own fighters are unsurprising.             He told The Independent: “Isis is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them. They do not flinch at killing anyone if they have committed a serious crime which goes against their interpretation of sharia, such as usury or embezzlement.

“Jihadist groups have a strict no corruption policy, meaning that while they can benefit financially from charging bank transactions and claiming a percentage of everyone’s monthly income, they don’t extort people like some secular groups have done in the past.”

The news comes after research carried out by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College in London, which monitors social media accounts of alleged jihadists, suggests 24 fighters from Britain are dead."
1059,"Reports have claimed that Apple is ready to announce an acquisition of Path, the struggling social network. Pando, citing an anonymous source working in Apple's engineering team, claims that the social network may be integrated into Apple's Messages app.

So what will Apple be getting when it acquires Path? Here's a guide.

One of Path's most unique features is just how much power it gives users over who can see their posts. Users are limited to just 150 friends, with no option to share posts publicly.

As well as sharing posts to their friends, Path users can also create an ""Inner Circle"" of friends who can see their most private posts.

Path is often praised for its design, with Apple even featuring the social network in keynote slides. The app includes minimalist navigation icons and clock hands that spin as you scroll through the timeline.

Apple's short-lived iTunes Ping service allowed users to share the music they were listening to, as well as keep track of famous musicians. Shuttered two years after its launch, the app failed to gain a significant number of users.

But a major feature of Path is very similar to Apple's Ping service. The app offers the ability to share what music you're listening to with friends.

One of Path's more unique features is the ability to share what times you go to sleep and wake up. Tap the sleep button, and Path will ask you whether you're conscious or not.

Select ""Go to Sleep"" and the app shows a night sky and a moon to get you in the mood.

When you wake up, tap the ""Awake"" button next to the sun icon to inform all of your Path friends that you are awake.

Path's latest update was the launch of a new messaging app in June. Path Talk lets you messages your Path friends, as well as share a whole load of information about yourself through the app.

As well as sensing when you're traveling on trains and in cars, the app can also continually broadcast your battery level.

Currently, Path earns money by selling virtual stickers and photo filters.

The app also sells a ""Premium"" subscription that gives you unlimited virtual stickers and photo filters.

1062,"I’ve been thinking about the blurred lines between Apple’s luxury tech products and high-end jewelry ever since it was first revealed that Apple Stores average more sales per square foot than iconic diamond retailer Tiffany & Co.

Apple is apparently thinking about it, too, since 9to5Mac reporter Mark Gurman claims the Cupertino company is taking a page out of luxury jewelers’ playbook by keeping its 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition devices in specially installed safes. These custom safes will be fitted with Apple Watch MagSafe chargers to ensure their safety.

Set to arrive this April, the Apple Watch will offer numerous pricing options, starting at $350 and likely running into the thousands. They will come in two bezel colors: silver and gold, along with a range of different leather and sport bands.

The smartwatch itself was unveiled along with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus on September 9 last year. In addition to numerous sensors, the Apple Watch’s big selling point is its ""Digital Crown,"" which allows wearers to control apps on the watch’s sapphire display. Currently the devices are being tested by hundreds of Apple employees to ensure that as many bugs as possible are eliminated by launch date.

Apple is also getting ready to switch up the current Apple Store layout to include Apple Watch display tables, along with an area where people can try on different band materials and color options. Finally, the company is said to be investing in scales that they can use to weigh the amount of gold in Apple Watch Edition units should they be returned or replaced.

While these security measures may strike some as extreme, Apple Stores have long been a target for break-ins—with some thieves even ""ram raiding"" the heavy glass doors at the front in order to make off with thousands of dollars in tech gadgets.

With the Apple Watch being the company's biggest launch since the original iPad in 2010, it's better to be safe than sorry.

1078,"It was like any other wedding ceremony in India, where 25-year-old Jugal Kishore was to wed 23-year-old Indira.

But once the varmala ceremony – where the groom garlands his wife to be – started, the groom suddenly had an epileptic fit, and fell to the ground.

Multiple news outlets reported that the bride, upon realising that the groom and his family had kept this serious medical condition from her, was furious. In her angered state, she allegedly declared that she would happily marry Harpal Singh, one of the guests at the wedding. The reports further state that Singh, incidentally, was her sister’s brother-in-law.

Singh, dressed in a leather jacket and jeans, was completely taken aback by the strange situation, and after a bit of hesitation, declared that he would willingly marry Indira.

The ceremony continued with the substitution of grooms, Singh and Indira together participating in the varmala ceremony, after which the pandit, officiating the ceremony, recited the mantras and asked the new couple to take the seven pheras, a ritual in Hindu weddings in which the couple make several rounds around a sacred fire.

Kishore, meanwhile, had been rushed to the hospital, and when he regained consciousness, returned to find his fiancée already wed.

The Times of India reported that Kishore requested that Indira reconsider her decision, for fear that he wouldn’t be able to face anyone after this ordeal. His relatives also interjected, and soon the scene turned violent, with plates and cutlery being used as weapons as guests aggressively tried to change Indira’s mind.

The woman allegedly stood by her decision.

An FIR was later filed at the Milak police station in Rampur district by the groom’s family, but it was reportedly withdrawn soon after.

A Kurdish Female fighter,who gained online celebrity status for killing '100 ISIS fighters' reportedly may have been captured and beheaded by the Islamic State fighters in Kobani. Twitter
Over the past week, social media has been abuzz with claims that young Kurdish female soldier Rehana was captured by the Islamic State militants and beheaded.
The Kurdish militia has neither denied nor confirmed the reports till now. The young Kurdish girl, who appears to be using pseudonym Rehana, became an online celebrity after a picture of her making a victory sign along with the caption, ""Rehana has killed more than 100 ISIS terrorists in Kobane"", was posted online by a journalist.
The female fighter for the Kurdish YPJ, or Women's Defense Unit, came to be regarded as a symbol of hope for Kurdish supporters overnight. Several supporters of the group have now come forward with evidence to prove that Rehana has not been beheaded.
A Kurdish journalist, Rashad Abdel Qader, on his Twitter account stated that Rehana is alive. He also, however, pointed out that the claim that Rehana killed 100 ISIS fighters might be exaggerated. ""Spoke to #Rehana she's sound Re& safe. #dailymail's is not true, she didn't kill 100 #ISIS but fighting fiercely #Kobanes,""Rashad abdelQader @RashadAbdlQader tweeted.
A report in 9News claimed that citing 'unconfirmed' reports that there are speculations about Rehana being killed by ISIS as the terrorist group had posted gruesome photos of 'her' decapitated body on the social media.
Another journalist and Kurdish supporter Pawan Durani @PawanDurani noted that it was all an ISIS propaganda. ""Let #ISIS produce even a single picture of Rehana .... Propaganda and falsehood runs in their blood .... Rehana keeps hunting them,"" Durani tweeted.
?
The supporters also have posted a CNN video shot in Rojava-Kurdistan (Western Kurdistan) titled 'Is an enemy of ISIS a friend of America?' as proof that Rehana is alive. In the online discussion forums, the supporters say that the video, aired on 26 October, proves that the young Kurdish fighter is alive. The girl, who appears at 00:07- 00:08 minute in the video a holding a flag and a gun with light brown gunstock, (third from left) is Rehana.
A Mirror report also noted that Kurdish resistance had denied the ISIS claims that they have beheaded poster girl 'Rehana.' The story, however, has no official statement from any of the Kurdish militia.
The young girl, who appears to be in her twenties, has become a symbol of Kurdish resistance movement against Islamic State. Rehana is one among a few hundreds of young girls fighting for the Kurdish Peshmerga militia, which has an Independent Women's Battalion known as the YPJ.
The female Kurdish fighters are literally the backbone of the Kurdish resistance movement in Kobani, also spelled Kobane. ISIS has much to gain from spreading rumours of death, especially in bringing down the morale of the Kurdish fighters."

Fierce fighting has been reported on the outskirts of Baghdad where ISIS militants are attempting to seize control of the Iraqi capital - despite ongoing Western airstrikes against the terror group.

The fighting is taking place just one mile to the west of the city, with government forces desperately trying to hold off the militants, who allegedly killed up to 1,000 soldiers during clashes yesterday.

ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country - enabling the terrorist group to seize further swaths of territory for their so-called caliphate.

Reports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East - an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White, vicar of the city's St George's Church, the only Anglican church in Iraq.

In a message posted on Facebook, the group said: 'The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has.

'Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little,' they added.

The claims were backed up by Canon White himself, who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from the centre of Baghdad.

In a message he also posted on Facebook, Canon White had said: 'The Islamic State are now within 10km of entering Baghdad. Over a 1000 Iraqi troops were killed by them yesterday, things are so bad. As I said all the military air strikes are doing nothing. If ever we needed your prayer it is now.'

A Ministry of Defence source said: 'No one makes a big fuss of having a female pilot. We have females in aircrews and ground crews and they are here because of their abilities. Everyone is just doing their jobs.'

The involvement of a woman RAF pilot comes amid reports that the family of Major Mariam Al Mansouri of the United Arab Emirates, who flew an F-16 jet in bombing raids against positions in Syria last week, has disowned her.

The news comes as RAF jets flew armed sorties for a second day over Iraq yesterday – but again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons.

Defence chiefs insisted that the flights by Tornado GR4 fighter-bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the Islamist jihadists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria, carrying out massacres.

But the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that Britain is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against Islamic State

It came as military commanders warned that Britain should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in Iraq to crush IS, which is also known as Isis and Isil.

Former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the UK could target the terrorists in Syria.

While the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the RAF's third mission had – like on Saturday – failed to locate any targets, US-led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under IS control in Syria, as well as a command centre.

The mobile refineries generate up to £1.2million a day for the militants.

On a mission: The RAF jets seek out their terror targets in Iraq - which they failed to find and bomb, again

Strong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. But ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country

Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama has acknowledged that US intelligence agencies underestimated the threat posed by ISIS extremists in Syria, and overestimated the capabilities of the Iraqi army.

Obama added that breaking up the terrorist cell will be a complicated battle involving both military and political action.

The president spoke about the multi-national effort against ISIS in a televised interview with 60 Minutes, which aired Sunday night.

Citing earlier comments by James Clapper, director of national intelligence, Mr Obama acknowledged that U.S. intelligence didn't take seriously enough what had been taking place in Syria.

'Well I think, our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria,' Mr Obama said.

Conversely, the United States overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to fight the militant groups, Obama said in the interview taped on Friday, days after the president made his case at the United Nations for action.

President Obama says the US intelligence agencies underestimated Islamic State activity in Syria and overestimated the Iraqi army's role to fight back against militants

Speaking to CBS's 60 Minutes, he said the militants had used the chaos of the Syrian civil war, when large swathes of the country were ungoverned, to 'reconstitute themselves'

Militants: The terrorist-group ISIS has been taking large swaths of Syria and Iraq in the recent absence of a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq

The U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group is growing, with dozens of countries among its ranks. The coalition is contributing a wide range of efforts, from carrying out airstrikes to providing military assistance and humanitarian aid.

Here are some of the key partners in the coalition.

UNITED STATES

The U.S., which is leading the coalition, has launched dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets. It also has sent military advisers, supplies and humanitarian aid to help Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces beat back the insurgents.

GULF STATES

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have participated in airstrikes in Syria. A fourth, Qatar, has played what the Pentagon called a supporting role.

The Emirates and Qatar also host air bases that are being used for the coalition's aerial campaign against the Islamic State group. U.S. Navy ships involved in the airstrikes are assigned to the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. Saudi Arabia has agreed to host training facilities for Syrian rebels on its territory.

JORDAN

Jordan has launched airstrikes against Islamic State positions, with government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani calling the move 'necessary in light of continuous attempts to infiltrate our borders.' The kingdom didn't give any specifics about its operations, but said the airstrikes aim to insure the country's security.

EGYPT

Egypt hasn't announced any specific participation in airstrikes, but President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told the AP that Egypt is 'completely committed to giving support,' and will do 'whatever is required' to support the coalition.

ISRAEL

Israel is offering intelligence estimates and concrete intelligence to the U.S. on the Islamic State group as part of ongoing intelligence sharing between the two countries, an Israeli defense official said. But, he added, Israel wasn't asked to contribute anything beyond that. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the issue. The prime minister's office declined to comment.

BRITAIN

Britain said that Tornado fighter bombers, supported by air-to-air refueling aircraft and signals intelligence, are operating over Iraq. Britain's media has widely reported that six warplanes are on standby in Cyprus, but defense officials have declined to offer specific numbers. Ben Goodlad from IHS Jane's has said that the Tornado jets offer the coalition enhanced capability to engage moving targets. Britain also has two weapons for long-range strikes: the Tornado's Storm Shadow cruise missile and the submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missile, he said.

FRANCE

France has carried out airstrikes in Iraq on two occasions since joining the U.S.-led coalition on Sept. 19, firing laser-guided bombs from Rafale fighter planes upon munitions and military hardware stockpiles — first near northern Mosul, then on Thursday, near Fallujah. France is conducting the operations in Iraq from a French air base in the United Arab Emirates. The base, with about 750 French service personnel and six Rafales, is 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) from Mosul, meaning that the planes need refueling in flight to strike in Iraq.

AUSTRALIA

An Australian air force contingent, including eight F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters and two support aircraft, has arrived in the United Arab Emirates. About 600 troops — most of them air force personnel — are being deployed with the aircraft. The jets are expected to be used in airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq, although the Australian government has yet to commit to a combat role.

BELGIUM

Six F-16 multirole fighters and a contingent of 120 support staff, including eight pilots, to be based in Jordan. Authorized to take part in operations over Iraq for one month, subject to extension if approved by the Belgian government.

DENMARK

Denmark has pledged seven F-16 fighter jets — four operational planes and three reserve jets along with pilots and support staff for 12 months. The U.S. also has asked Danes to provide military trainers to Iraq to school Iraqi and Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State group on the ground. Denmark has already contributed a transport plane with personnel to a U.S.-led humanitarian operation in northern Iraq.

CANADA

Canada has contributed about 70 special operations soldiers to offer instruction to Kurdish forces battling Islamic State militants in northern Iraq. Early this week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Cabinet will be considering a U.S. request to support airstrikes against Islamic State forces. This could include five to eight CF-18 fighter aircraft as well as tanker aircraft. Canada has already contributed two military cargo planes that carried weapons to Kurdish fighters.

GERMANY

Germany isn't participating in any airstrikes against the Islamic State group. They have sent weapons to Kurdish fighters in Irbil, and a group of Kurdish peshmerga fighters arrived in Germany to receive weapons' training here by the German army. There's also German military in Irbil to train the peshmerga fighters in Irbil.

GREECE

Greece is participating with humanitarian aid and by sending ammunition for Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State group. They haven't specified any more details on quantities or type of humanitarian aid.

GEORGIA

Georgia will be providing humanitarian assistance, not military aid, according to comments made by Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili on Thursday to local news websites.

HUNGARY

Hungary has promised to send 15 types of ammunition totaling nearly 6 million units to Iraqi Kurds. Most of the ammunition, 4.1 million cartridges, was the M43 type for the AK-47 assault rifle.

ROMANIA

Prime Minister Victor Ponta said his country would offer 'logistic, operational and humanitarian' support to the coalition, but not troops. He provided no details of the assistance.

POLAND

Poland supports the coalition against the Islamic State, but is not actively engaged in combat."

This is Hessler's second run-in with viral fame: Back in December 2013, she made a man wear a dunce cap and a sign that says ""I beat women"" on a busy street corner after he reportedly beat her up. Hessler never followed up with police following the incident.

1100,"Wounded? Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader the so-called Islamic State, is said to be among those targeted

American war planes have reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS leaders, critically wounding their leader.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hurt in the strikes today, according to local witnesses and government sources.

Two witnesses confirmed that bombs had fallen on the town of al-Qaim, next to the Syrian border.

Local government sources described how an aircraft had swooped over a meeting of senior ISIS figures and dropped its payload, killing more than a dozen people.

Another witness said that eight people had died when a bomb struck a market.

A local hospital was said to be overwhelmed with the volume of patients from the raid - including al-Baghdadi.

Local ISIS officials were reportedly roaming the streets with loudspeakers ordering residents to donate blood to help the wounded.

Striking Baghdadi would be the most significant blow yet in the campaign against ISIS, who have been defiant in the face of sustained air attacks from the U.S. Air Force and allies.

A provincial leader from Anbar in western Iraq, as well as his deputy, are said to be among those killed instantly by the bombs.

Al-Qaim and the neighbouring Syrian town of Albukamal are on a strategic supply route linking territory held by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

The so-called Caliph, who declared himself leader of all the world's Muslims in a televised speech, was formerly a prisoner of the U.S. during their occupation of Iraq.

The shady figure was eventually released, and rose through the ranks of the jihadist groups which eventually united to form ISIS, or the Islamic State.

Iraqi security officials could not immediately comment on the reported raid. The U.S. military did not confirm or deny the strike.

Attacks: Two strikes were reported, one at al-Qaim, near the Syria-Iraq border, and a second in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul

Separately, the coalition of air forces, which includes Great Britain's RAF and Canadian fighter planes, struck a convoy just outside Mosul, ISIS's stronghold city in northern Iraq.

U.S. officials would not confirm or deny whether Baghdadi, the group's overall leader, had been targeted, though one said that the coalition's airstrikes had not been targeting any particular meeting.

IS-affiliated Twitter accounts rushed to deny the reports, with one tweeting: 'I can report to the Muslims that Amir Al-Momineen Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi Hafid hu'allah is alive and well.'

Prisoner: al-Baghdadi, shown before his rise to power, was held as a prisoner by the U.S. during the occupation of Iraq

The hardline Sunni Islamic State's drive to form a caliphate in the two countries has helped return sectarian violence in Iraq to the dark days of 2006-2007, the peak of its civil war.

It has also created a cross-border sanctuary for Arab militants, as well as foreign fighters whose passports could allow them to evade detection in Western airports.

The U.S. strikes coincide with violence elsewhere in Iraq, after jihadist-style attacks hit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.

On Saturday night a car bomb killed eight people in Baghdad's mostly Shi'ite Sadr City, police and hospital sources said.

The blasts bring to 28 the day's toll from bombs in the Iraqi capital and the western city of Ramadi.

Two bombs exploded in separate attacks in Baghdad's mainly Shi'ite Amil district, said a police source.

'A driver parked his car and went to a cigarette stall, then he disappeared. Then his car blew up, killing passers-by,' the source said, describing one of the two attacks in Amil.

In the mostly Shi'ite al-Amin area of Baghdad, another car bomb killed eight people, medical sources said.

The attack by a suicide bomber on a checkpoint in Ramadi in Anbar killed five soldiers. 'Before the explosion, the checkpoint was targeted with several mortar rounds. Then the suicide humvee bomber attacked it,' said a police official.

There was no claim of responsibility for the bombings, but they resembled operations carried out by Islamic militants.

In the town of Baquba, 40 miles northeast of Baghdad, a gunman killed a Shi'ite militiaman, and a car bomb targeting a police officer killed his 10-year-old son, security sources said.

Air strikes: The reports say that U.S. warplanes dropped bombs on the town of al-Qaim in Iraq. Pictured is an earlier strike against ISIS in Kobani, on the Turkey-Syria border

Western and Iraqi officials say U.S.-led air strikes are not enough to defeat the al Qaeda offshoot and Iraq must improve the performance of its security forces to eliminate the threat from the group, which wants to redraw the map of the Middle East.

President Barack Obama has approved sending up to 1,500 more troops to Iraq, roughly doubling the number of U.S. forces on the ground, to advise and retrain Iraqis in their battle against Islamic State.

The Iraqi prime minister's media office said the additional U.S. trainers were welcome but the move, five months after Islamic State seized much of northern Iraq, was belated, state television reported.

Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is the relatively discreet leader of the Islamic State extremist group.

He used to play for his mosque's soccer team and has a PhD in Islamic history.

But after spending four years in a US camp during the Iraq occupation, he emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world.

The government placed a $10 million bounty on his head in 2011 when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous.

This warrant was publicized once more following the beheadings of US nationals James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning.

He maintained a low profile for months as ISIS, the group's original name, rose to global infamy and Al Qaeda denounced them as 'too extreme'.

But he finally revealed himself to the public with a speech, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the first week of July this year.

Born Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarri in 1971 near Samarra, Iraq, he came from a Sufi family - a tolerant form of Islam.

In the 1990s, he completed a PhD in Baghdad and played soccer with friends.

But he fell out with mosque leaders and fled to Anbar province where he joined Sunni groups protesting the US occupation.

American forces detained Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2005 shortly after the Iraq invasion. He was released when the camp closed in 2009.

He was thought to be 'bad but not the worst' sources told The Daily Beast.

But he then joined the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria, and rose up the ranks rapidly.

After allegedly killing the leader, Abu Omar Baghdadi, he took hold of the terror group.

The United States spent $25billion on the Iraqi military during the U.S. occupation that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 and triggered an insurgency that included al Qaeda.

Washington wants Iraq's Shi'ite-led government to revive an alliance with Sunni tribesmen in Anbar province which helped U.S. Marines defeat al Qaeda.

Such an alliance would face a more formidable enemy in Islamic State, which has more firepower and funding.

Police Colonel Shaaban Barazan al-Ubaidi, commander of a rapid reaction force in Anbar, said security forces retook eight villages. His account could not be immediately confirmed."

Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle said a woman sitting two rows in front of him on the team's commercial flight was stung by a scorpion. ""The woman was a real champ,"" he said. ""She acted like it was a mosquito bite.""
The woman reported being stung on the hand, and the plane returned to the gate, where she was checked by medical personnel but declined further treatment.

Alaska Airlines stated that it is uncertain how the scorpion got on the plane but acknowledged that the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, where the plane was on the ground for approximately one hour.

Reached by phone aboard the plane Saturday night before the team took off for Oregon, Beavers coach Wayne Tinkle told ESPN that the woman was sitting two rows in front of him.

""The plane was coming from Mexico before us, and [the scorpion] was on the plane,'' Tinkle said. ""The woman was a real champ. She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her but the needle was stuck.""

Alaska Airlines stated that flight attendants killed the scorpion before maintenance staff checked the plane's overhead bins. The airline planned to have an exterminator ""thoroughly check the plane"" once the flight arrived in Portland.

'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy follows a group of characters that set to destroy the One Ring, since it can also be used to control other peoples and kingdoms.

Steward told The New York Daily News 'Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly.'

ANTAKYA, Turkey — Middlemen with ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have turned to a grim new method of trying to secure funds in recent days. With the group having failed to strike deals to ransom the U.S. hostages in its custody — instead beheading three of them since July — its intermediaries are now trying to negotiate the sale of the body of at least one of the men it killed.

Three sources in contact with ISIS or its associates told BuzzFeed News that it wants to sell the remains of James Foley, the U.S. journalist whose August death was the first in a series of high-profile executions of Western hostages by ISIS hands.  They said ISIS wants $1 million for Foley’s body, which it would deliver across the border to Turkey, and that the group was willing to provide a DNA sample to facilitate a deal.

If true, the attempted sale would highlight the ruthlessness behind the hostage-taking enterprise that has provided ISIS with deep reservoirs of funds and publicity — as well as the group’s cold calculation as it works to raise more cash.

At one point early this year, ISIS held 23 Western hostages in Syria. Fifteen Europeans were freed as governments reportedly paid millions of dollars in ransoms, but the British and American hostages remained. Both governments refuse to negotiate for hostages or to allow families to pay ransoms. In the months since Foley’s death, ISIS has released videotaped executions of the U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, the British aid worker Alan Henning, and the U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. British journalist John Cantlie and a U.S. woman, a 26-year-old aid worker, remain in ISIS hands.

All three of the sources seeking to act as middlemen in a deal with the secretive extremists have been granted anonymity to protect their safety.

One, a former Syrian rebel fighter, has ties to ISIS commanders dating to the early stages of Syria’s civil war. He said he has served as an intermediary in hostage negotiations with Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, and with ISIS. One day this fall, to prove his bona fides in the murky trade, he opened his iPhone to display unpublished videos of Western hostages in Nusra’s custody.

This former rebel said he was approached by an ISIS leader who asked him to find a channel to either the U.S. government or Foley’s family. Like the other sources, he noted a price of $1 million and the promise of DNA. “They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,” he said. “They will not give the DNA without the money.”

He claimed his motivation was to help the grieving family find closure, calling his work “a humanity case.”

Another intermediary, a businessman who has sought to use his own ISIS connections to facilitate hostage deals in the past, was candid about his goals: “This is business.”

The trade in Western hostages has created a shadowy marketplace in which middlemen like these seek to negotiate deals in order to receive commission. They might inflate their connections on one side of proposed negotiations in order to draw interest from the other, so they can make a case for being included in the transaction. The idea of selling Foley’s body has drawn attention among some of these middlemen of late, according to a Syrian who was involved with previous negotiations with ISIS over U.S. hostages.

Both the former rebel fighter and the businessman said that one point person for the negotiations would be a senior official in the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the U.S.-backed rebel coalition, who was involved in previous ISIS talks over U.S. hostages as well as deals to free European ones. In an interview in Antakya, this FSA official expressed dismay that word of the attempted sale of Foley’s remains had leaked. He urged this reporter not to publish an article on the subject, fearing that the attention could sabotage any potential deal.

Of particular concern, he said, was that the U.S. government might seek to put a stop to it. Having allowed the U.S. hostages to die in ISIS custody, he reasoned, it would look bad if such a deal succeeded now. Foley’s parents have said that the U.S. government threatened them with prosecution if they paid a ransom for their son’s release. “It will be like a shame for the U.S. government,” the FSA official said. “People will ask why you brought the body but you didn’t bring him when he was alive.”

The FSA official described himself as the “manager” of the proposed negotiations. He was in touch with a middleman representing ISIS, he said, and if a deal progressed would seek to arrange it with someone representing the Foley family.

As before, ISIS seemed intent on making money from its hostage enterprise by any means. “They were trying to negotiate (a ransom deal) for his freedom before they beheaded him, and after beheading him, they are trying to sell his body,” the FSA official said.

The Foley family had no comment for this article.

An official with the U.S. State Department said “we are seeking more information” on whether ISIS is trying to sell the remains of U.S. hostages. A senior U.S. diplomat called the idea “disgusting.”

1124,"It’s a well-known fact that a woman’s jealousy is not something to be underestimated, and that applies all the more so to a scorned wife who has been cheated on by her husband.

In a bizarre, but true illustration of that edict, a jealous wife in China, 30-year-old Feng Lung, reported chopped her husband’s penis off with a pair of sharp scissors, not once, but twice, in order to teach him a lesson for his infidelity.

Having found out her husband was cheating on her, the woman sliced off his penis, which was reattached successfully by surgeons in Shangqiu in central China’s Henan province. When she saw her husband had sent a raunchy email to his mistress once again, she severed his member a second time.

Lung is now facing jail after being arrested for causing grievous bodily harm to her husband, 32-year-old, Fan Lung.

The Mirror reports that surgeons were able to reattach the penis, but when the jealous wife found the email on her phone, she reportedly sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window.

The man ran outside the hospital to confront his wife and to find his severed penis. He was seen naked and pouring with blood in the street outside the facility.

A hospital spokesman told reporters, “The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital. Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.”

Despite an extensive search by police officers at the scene, the man’s penis was never located, and authorities believe it may have been eaten by a stray dog or cat.

The hospital spokesman added, ‘The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery. He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.”"
1126,"One of the world's most wanted men ""Jihadi John"" has reportedly been wounded in an airstrike.

Jihadi John”, the man accused of executing British hostages David Haines and Alan Henning and two Americans held by Isil, may have been injured in an airstrike on an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border a week ago.

The Foreign Office said it had received reports the terrorist had been wounded but could not confirm them.

A spokesman said it did not have the resources in Syria to enable it to verify the rumours but confirmed the office had received reports.

The Mail On Sunday reported that the British-accented militant had been wounded while attending a meeting of slamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil) leaders and was rushed to hospital following the US-led attack on a bunker in Al Qaim, western Iraq, last Saturday that killed around 10 Isil commanders and wounded 40 more.

The Mail reported that it was the same attack that injured elusive Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, sparking initial rumours that he had been killed.

""Jihadi John"", named after Beatle John Lennon due to his British background, is believed to be responsible for the murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers Mr Haines and Mr Henning.

The masked executioner, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, has become a leading figure in the Islamist group.

The Mail claimed that a nurse who treated some of those wounded in the attack said there was a man named Jalman on her list, referring to him as ""the one who slaughtered the journalists"".

The wounded men were then driven to the Isil's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa, according to the Mail's source.

British intelligence officers estimate that there are around 500 home-grown militants fighting for Isil in Syria and Iraq, and Prime Minister David Cameron this week announced plans to stop them returning to Britain for two years.

He said jihadis who have travelled to fight with extremists will not be able to return to Britain for two years.

Did Mitt Romney make the statement noted below on the Laura Ingraham show on 1/12/14. Was this the exact statement made? Was it taken out of context? or...?

""It's false advertising to call Mrs. Obama the First Lady. First Woman, maybe, but certainly not a lady. Ann Romney is an actual lady.""

Origins: On 13 January 2015, the Facebook group ""Stop the World, The Teabaggers Want to Get Off"" posted an image of Mitt Romney along with a quote attributed to him about First Lady Michelle Obama:

The image alleges Romney made the displayed comment about referring to Michelle Obama as the ""First Woman"" rather than the ""First Lady"" during an appearance on the Laura Ingraham Show on 12 January 2014. A search of that radio program's guest archives , however, shows the former presidential candidate was not a guest on the show on that date. Romney's purported comments about the First Lady are also suspiciously missing from political blogs and major newspapers.

Furthermore, the ""Stop the World"" Facebook group has garnered a reputation for attributing fictitious quotes to conservative politicians. On 27 November 2014, that group posted a dubious diatribe attributed to Congresswoman Michele Bachmann about the ""red Indian"" and Thanksgiving, and on 1 January 2015 it claimed Sarah Palin had made offensive comments about ""white privilege.""

While the Facebook page does not contain a disclaimer labeling it a satirical site, it is clear ""Stop the World, The Teabaggers Want to Get Off"" should not be considered a trusted source of political information.

1142,"Ever since allegations against Bill Cosby resurfaced, fans who were in denial all these years have had to embrace the fifth stage of grief-acceptance.

As difficult as it is to imagine the vibrant-coloured-sweater wearing father figure -- who made us laugh through childhood all the way into adulthood -- could be a serial rapist, it is hard to ignore the latest accuser, Raven Symone who stole everyone's heart as little Olivia Kendall in ""The Cosby Show"".

According to Hip-Hop Hangover, former child actor Symone told TMZ officials that she too had been drugged and raped by Cosby following the wrapping up of ""The Cosby Show"". The site claims that there were even rumours about Cosby disallowing Symone from appearing in the last season of the show initially and later abruptly changing his mind.

According to a statement from her lawyer, ""...we among so many others are tired of the media worshipping and praising a man that has a past so terrible that it is unbelievable. My client (Raven-Symone) is also ready to tell her side of the story. A side that was kept quiet because of threats from being blackballed. There was no monetary compensation that made my client keep quiet, but more so the respect for Mr. Cosby. Well that respect has come to an end. And what we thought was a mistake or anomaly has surfaced to become a lifestyle. We will be pursuing damages that are not going to be disclosed at this time.""

Symone's allegations strengthen the accusations of various other women including music industry publicist and journalist Joan Tarshis, actress Barbara Bowman and 15 others.

In one of the most revealing interviews, Tarshis told CNN that when she was just 19 years old, Cosby took her to his bungalow and gave her a drink, shortly after which she passed out. The next thing she remembers is him removing her underwear, she revealed. She went on to explain she used to ""idolise"" Cosby at the time and no one would have believed her anyway, which is why she refrained from coming out with the truth then.

""I assumed I was not the only girl that he was doing this with, but who's going to believe me? Bill Cosby, the all-American dad, the all-American husband, Mr Jell-O, the guy everybody loves. Who would believe me? They would probably think I was out to get something,"" Tarshis said.



Bowman, who also gave an all-revealing interview of her experiences with Cosby told CNN that she was thrilled at having him mentor her; a position he misused. One night while at his apartment, she passed out although she only had a single glass of wine.

Her next memory is of doubling over a toilet bowl in her underwear and a men's t-shirt, as Cosby held her hair back. She went on to add that throughout their working relationship the drug-facilitated rapes continued.

In an article for The Washington Post Bowman wrote, ""as a teenager, I tried to convince myself I had imagined it. I even tried to rationalize it: Bill Cosby was going to make me a star and this was part of the deal.""

During their last sexual encounter, Bowman says she tried to wrestle from his grasp, ""until he eventually gave up, angrily called me 'a baby' and sent me home to Denver.""



Meanwhile ""The View"" co-host Whoopie Goldberg expressed doubts over Bowman's accusations and invited her to come on the program and answer a few questions directly.

""Quite honestly, you know, look, I'm sorry, having been on both sides of this where people allege that you do something, it doesn't matter now... I have a lot of questions for the lady. Maybe she'll come on,"" Goldberg said.

Many women have alleged rape against Cosby since mid 2000s, however it was a 2-minute routine performed by comedian Hannibal Burress that brought it back to limelight. He said, ""Yeah, but you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches,"" Buress said. ""I've done this bit on stage and people think I'm making it up.... when you leave here, Google 'Bill Cosby rape.' That sh** has more results than 'Hannibal Buress'"".

While Cosby still remains silent on the rape accusations against him, a 1969 stand-up routine, ironically titled ""It's True! It's True!"" has him explaining how as a kid he had heard about a wonder drug -- ""Spanish Fly"" -- that would make a girl go crazy once it was put into her drink. He then goes on to speak of his interest in such a drug, which could have been a prelude to Cosby living his fantasy of stripping women of their ability to say ""no""."
1147,"Version 8.2 of Apple's iOS mobile operating system could launch as soon as Monday with new and improved health features in tow. That's the same day the company is expected to unveil more details on its Apple Watch.

The maker of the iPhone and iPad mobile gadgets was close to releasing iOS 8.2 to the public earlier, blog Boy Genius Report said on Thursday, but instead decided to push out one final build to employees and testers. The change log for that build reveals several new features and enhancements in the health department as well as a host of bug fixes, according to BGR.

The Apple Watch faces an increasingly competitive market already crowded with devices from other players. To entice a wide range of buyers, Apple designed its first wearable as both a smartwatch and a health and fitness monitor. So the health features baked into iOS 8 need to be solid if Apple hopes to capture the fitness crowd.

Based on the change log, the new and improved health features in iOS 8.2:

add the ability to select the unit of measurement for body temperature, weight, height, distance and blood glucose,
improve stability when dealing with large amounts of data,
include the ability to add and visualize workout sessions from third-party apps,
address an issue that may have prevented users from adding a photo in Medical ID,
fix units for vitamins and minerals,
fix an issue where health data wouldn't refresh after changes in data source order,
fix an issue where some graphics showed no data values, and
add a privacy setting that enables turning off tracking of steps, distance and flights climbed.
But iOS 8.2 is also designed as a bug squasher.

Life hasn't exactly been easy for Apple's iOS 8 since it launched last September. The initial version carried a few bugs that were supposed to be resolved a week later in iOS 8.0.1. But that edition came with even more bugs, prompting Apple to quickly pull it and launch 8.0.2. Since then Apple has rolled out versions 8.1, 8.1.2 and 8.1.3, all with some enhancements and bug fixes.

The bugs and multiple releases may account for the sluggish adoption of iOS 8, which has trailed that of its predecessor but is finally up to 75 percent of all devices that visited the App Store as of last Monday.

According to BGR, the bug fixes:

address an issue in Maps that prevented navigating to some favorite locations,
address an issue where the last word in a quick reply message wasn't autocorrected,
fix an issue where duplicate iTunes purchased content could prevent iCloud restore from completing,
resolve an issue where some music or playlists didn't sync from iTunes to the Music app,
fix an issue where deleted audiobooks sometimes remained on the device,
resolve an issue that could prevent call audio from routing to car speakers while using Siri Eyes Free,
fix a Bluetooth calling issue where no audio is heard until the call is answered,
fix a timezone issue where Calendar events appear in GMT,
address an issue that caused certain events in a custom reoccurring meeting to drop from Exchange calendar,
fix a certificate error that prevented configuring an Exchange account behind a third-party gateway,
fix an issue that could cause an organizer's Exchange meeting notes to be overwritten, and
resolve an issue that prevented some Calendar events from automatically showing as ""busy"" after accepting an invite.
The update also promises greater stability for Mail, Music, the Flyover feature in Maps, VoiceOver reliability, and Connectivity with Made for iPhone Hearing Aids.

A spokeswoman for Apple declined CNET's request for comment. But you can learn more about the Apple Watch and see if iOS 8.2 really will launch Monday by tuning in to CNET's live blog and show starting at 9 a.m. PT Monday."
1150,"Gwen Korovin, Joan Rivers’s personal ear, nose and throat doctor who allegedly performed an unauthorized procedure on the late comedian while she was under anesthesia for an endoscopy, has denied taking a selfie with Rivers while she was in the procedure room.

According to a report by CNN, Korovin “categorically denies” taking the selfie, and also denies performing the unauthorized procedure on Rivers. Days ago, CNN reported that clinic employees told investigators the doctor took the photo and performed said procedure.

Said CNN:

CNN’s source close to the investigation also provided new details Thursday, including that a sedated Rivers was visible in Korovin’s procedure room selfie. Clinic workers told investigators they heard Korovin make a statement to the effect that Rivers “will think this is funny” or “would love this” as she took the photo, the source said. Investigators do not have access to the phone Korovin used to take the photo, the source said.

Rivers went to Yorkville Endoscopy on Aug. 28 to find out why she had a sore throat and her voice was hoarse. CNN’s sources maintain Rivers stopped breathing when her vocal cords began to swell, and she went into cardiac arrest. Rivers died Sept. 4 at age 81 after going on life support at Mount Sinai Hospital.

Previous reports stated Rivers stopped breathing after a botched attempt at a biopsy. CNN is now reporting that she stopped breathing after Korovin attempted a second laryngoscopy following an endoscopy. Korovin also performed a laryngoscopy prior to the endoscopy.

Here’s the letter Korovin’s lawyer sent to the network:

Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city’s most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient. For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin’s personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients."

""I was so shocked I didn't feel a thing—then I saw I was bleeding and my penis was gone.""

The girl, whose name is known to African Eye News Service (AENS) but cannot be published because she is under age, attacked Humphrey Khoza with battery acid while he was drinking beers with friends at a tavern in Cork village near Hazyview, Mpumalanga, on January 17.

""Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle but I didn’t realise that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex,"" said Khoza.

Khoza said he had been dating the schoolgirl since December.

""We agreed to have sex, but she was not aware that I was filming the sex using my laptop computer. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still
don’t know how it got onto social media,"" he said.

In the viral video that AENS has seen to verify the claims, Khoza is seen pushing the girl, who was in her school uniform, to the bed. She appeared not to notice that she was being filmed while they had sex.

The remorseful Khoza added that although his penis would never work again due to the damage caused by the acid, he was lucky to be alive.

He said he was advised to press charges against the girl, but doesn't see the point.

""Even if I press charges it is useless because it won’t bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts,"" said Khoza.

He now has to urinate through a tube and has to undergo surgery."
1189,"Microsoft -- the parent company of the Xbox and Windows brands -- is apparently ""in serious discussions"" to purchase Mojang, according to The Wall Street Journal. Mojang, of course, is best-known for its massively popular Minecraft series.

WSJ cites ""a person with knowledge of the matter"" in their story, and says the valuation of Mojang could be more than $2 billion. Microsoft and Mojang both declined to comment to WSJ; we've reached out to Mojang for additional comment.

Mojang, founded by developer Markus Persson in 2009, has two still-unreleased games in development -- Cobalt and Scrolls -- as well as Minecraft, which it's still endlessly iterating on with updates and ports.
Microsoft's investment to purchase Mojang, if true, would give the company complete control over not only the studio's upcoming games, but it's all-important, insanely lucrative Minecraft series. As of June, the game has sold over 54 million copies, and has actually sold best on consoles, which bodes well for Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Xbox One.

Minecraft launched in late 2011 on PC, and we loved it. It later migrated to iOS and Android before coming to Xbox 360 in 2012, where it sold like gangbusters. A PlayStation 3 iteration launched late in 2013, which we also loved, and the game just came to both Xbox One and PlayStation 4. You can read our review here. The only other known, upcoming version of the game -- for Vita -- is due out in the coming couple of months.

What do you make of this news? Do you think Microsoft will purchase Mojang? If so, do you think it will benefit the company?"

Several Gulf area and UK media outlets reported that the airline planned to seat unrelated men and women after receiving complaints.

“There are solutions to this problem,"" Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, an assistant marketing manager for Saudia, was quoted as saying to Saudi Arabia daily Ajel. ""We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.""

Although Ajel reported that those solutions would include separating men and women unless they are closely related, the source of the quote said the story was fabricated, and that his quote was taken out of context.

@RunwayGirl @JetwayMJ my name was mentioned there, it is a total false and fabrication.

@RunwayGirl we are trying a solution and awaiting the outcome(.)It is on how to rearrange splitting family members aboard but got twisted:)

The rumor was perhaps more believable after an incident last week, when ultra-Orthodox Jewish men delayed an Israel-bound Delta flight because they refused to sit next to female passengers.

And Saudi Arabia has persistent gender disparities: The World Economic Forum ranked Saudi Arabia 127th out of 136 countries for women's rights in its Global Gender Gap Report in 2013.

There are restrictions on women — for example, they are not permitted to drive in the country — however there have also been signs of recent change. Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah announced in 2011 that women would be able to vote in 2015 elections.

Saudia is a member of the SkyTeam alliance.

1204,"The anonymous note between office colleagues was posted on Facebook

It was shared from a New Zealand radio station and went viral

It is a hilarious note war between the colleagues over a stolen sandwich

The notes were posted on a fridge door in an office kitchen

A frustrated office worker's request to a colleague to stop pinching their lunch from the fridge has sparked a hilarious note war between the two.

The A4 notes pinned to the fridge door of an office kitchen have gone viral on a New Zealand radio Facebook page due to the hilarious content contained on them.

What starts as a simple request to the 'turkey and Swiss on Rye' owner to the 'sandwich thief' to stop stealing their lunch, soon turns into an anonymous office stand-off with several demands being traded.

The passive-aggressive note which started the war between the two office workers

The first demand from the anonymous thief, which infuriates the sandwich thief even further

A return threat from the owner of the 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' that they will bring HR in to conversation

'To the person who keeps stealing my sandwiches (Turkey and Swiss with mayo on Rye)...' the first of many passive-aggressive notes reads.

'Stop stealing other people's property!!!'

What follows is one of several demands from the thief to pay $10 and leave it in the fridge in return for the person's lunch - or they'll 'never see it undigested again.'

The thief, a man, includes a picture of him holding a portion of the 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' - one of many he posts picture with him holding it to prove he has it in his possession.

Refusing to take the sandwich owner's advice to be a 'responsible adult' seriously, he further infuriates 'Turkey and Swiss on rye' who threatens the thief with human resources action.

The conversation loses its professionalism along the way and becomes increasingly personal, before 'Tina from HR' wades in with a note to the sandwich owner.

'Please return the sandwich to the owner and we won't investigate this any further,' Tina writes.

To which the thief replies: 'Buy me a pizza.'

Tina responds: 'No'

The image of the sandwich thief threatening to continue devouring the person's lunch if they don't put $10 in the fridge

The defeated sandwich owner asks...

More evidence that the man is in possession of the sandwich

The owner follows through on his threat to contact HR and a letter from Tina appears on the fridge door

The thief takes his demands to the top

Who would have thought? Tina refuses

The three-way dialogue continues until the thief posts a lengthy note with an image of an empty plate proving that he has devoured the sandwich in full.

It is at this point the alleged thief, 'Francis', is finally found out when Tina traces the printed A4 sheets back to his account.

'Francis we checked the office printer queue and traced the requests back to your desk. Could you please see me at your earliest convenience.'

The hilarious note war winds up with Francis grovelling for his job with a simple one-line request pleading not to be fired.

'Please don't fire me.'

The thief rubs it in even more

The sandwich owner cracks with their first personal spray at the thief

The thief devours the sandwich and posts the finished meal

Caught out: Francis's cover is blown

1207,"The Islamic State (ISIS) is harvesting organs of its victims to finance its terrorist army, the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations said Tuesday.

“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” said Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim, referring to the U.N. Security Council. “It is clear they are missing certain parts.” Here is how he described bodies as missing kidneys and showing marks of surgical incisions:
When we discover mass graves, we look at the bodies. Some of those bodies are killed by bullets, some of them by knives. But when you find pieces of the back is [sic] missing and the kidneys is [sic] missing, you will wonder what it is.
His report reveals that the ISIS never fails to shock the world. He declared that the ISIS executed a dozen doctors in Mosul because they refused to cooperate to remove organs.

Alhakim is replacing outgoing ambassador Nikolay Mladenov, who told the Security Council, “It’s very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day.”

The ISIS controls territory that includes the airports in Mosul in Iraq and Aleppo in Syria, giving it the ability to ship human organs to traffickers.

He said IS has access to airports in Mosul and in the Syrian city of Aleppo, from which it could transport the illicit organs to international middlemen and buyers.

No less shocking is that the Western world is treating the report as if it did not know months ago that the Islamic State has resorted to harvesting human organs.

Al-Monitor reported last December 5:
The third funding source [besides oil sales and taxes on residents] was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling.
Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

The Western world, not least of all the Obama administration, chose not to disseminate the information in hopes of postponing the inevitable – a declaration of war on the ISIS.

Valuable time has been lost by imagining that the Islamic State is the problem of Iraq and Syria and not of the entire world."
1209,"South African police have been accused of not doing enough to crack down on a sick new sport that replaces fighting dogs with children.

Kids as young as nine-years-old are getting onto all fours and scratching and biting other children, growling and snarling in the process.

And in a bizarre twist, the winners of the fights are rewarded just like a real dogs by allowing them to have sex with other children.

Although the sex act is only simulated, it has shocked the country after it was revealed in local media to become a regular happening in the district of Ekurhuleni in the South African city of Johannesburg.

Inspector Wendy Willson from the special investigations unit at the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) confirmed that they had started an investigation after reports that pupils were returning from breaktime with torn clothing and injuries.

Teachers then discovered the children were fighting each other in dog fighting role-play, while other pupils were placing bets on who would win. She said the activity had developed among children who had been watching real dogfights at the weekends with their parents and were mimicking the action at school. It is not clear if the children take part in the sport due to peer pressure or under encouragement of adults.

Willson said she had witnessed the children getting down on all fours – barking, growling, biting and scratching each other.

She said: ""They rip into each other. The play is aggressive enough to cause each other injury.""

She also recorded a video of one fight which was much tamer than what was really happening because the children were asked to provide an example.

She said: ""It’s incredibly disturbing that young children are being forced to be involved in this.""

Willson said it was unclear what role adults played in the new sport but she said it was clear that children had only become involved in the dogfights after witnessing the real thing.

She said she had been shocked by the discovery, adding: ""I have never seen this before. I searched for examples of children being used like this internationally and came up with nothing.""

The regional Department of Education said it had been made aware of these allegations early last year.

Spokeswoman Phumla Sekhonyane said: ""The department had contacted the SPCA to request their intervention."" She did not explain why they have not contacted the police nor why, although concerns had been raised, nothing significant had been done to help the children.

Director of child abuse charity Teddy Bear Clinic Shaheda Omar said it was the first time she had ever heard of the dog-fighting role-play taking place.

Omar said: ""I have seen cases where children violate animals and show no remorse, but never this.

""These children are being used. They are like cogs in a machine. I’m sure some sort of reward is offered and they are being socialised into that behaviour.

""Violence begets violence and the children are learning it from adults.""

The situation needed urgent, systemic intervention, and different departments needed to get involved to stop the abuse and the children’s behaviour, she said.

Omar said: ""If nothing is done, this will become a breeding ground for sociopaths."""

1228,"Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. claimed Wednesday that ISIS has been forcing doctors to harvest organs from the bodies of the people it's killed, and then selling those organs to fund its operations, according to an AP report. Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim called for a Security Council investigation into alleged mass graves full of bodies with surgical scars and missing kidneys.

According to Alkalim, a dozen doctors have been killed in Mosul because they wouldn't take part in the Islamic State's organ trafficking scheme.

Unconfirmed rumors of ISIS removing and selling organs have been around since at least December, when Middle East news outlet Al-Monitor published an article with more detailed claims than Alkalim made this week.

Based on a report from one doctor in Mosul, Al-Monitor wrote:

Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs ... the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said.
The Al-Monitor story also claims that the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed ""the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest,"" a claim that was widely repeated by news sites in December, but seems to be based entirely on this single source. (As far as I can tell, there's no mention of the trafficking operation in OHCHR's published reports on Iraq, and Alkalim didn't mention OHCHR in his statement to the Security Council.)

The Islamic State is incredibly money-hungry, Newsweek reported in a detailed look at the revenue streams ISIS uses to support the 8 million people in its territories, including more than 10,000 active fighters. There's no mention of selling kidneys, but ISIS needs all the money it can get, and if they're willing to conduct small-time local kidnappings for as little as $500, moving organs isn't so farfetched.

There's still no conclusive evidence, though. The Islamic State is the international boogeyman of the moment, and its confirmed actions are heinous enough to make any rumor sound plausible, but it's also been the subject of several online hoaxes and conspiracy theories.

It's probably best to withhold judgment until the U.N. does what Alkahim suggests and examines the bodies."
1229,"Apple is forecast to have shipped a whopping 73 million iPhones over the 2014 holiday quarter on strong iPhone 6 demand, according to one well-connected analyst who also expects a busy start to 2015 for the company, with Apple Watch sales in March and a rumored 12-inch MacBook Air coming sometime before April.

In a research note from well-connected KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo obtained by AppleInsider, Apple's latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models led a charge to 73 million overall unit sales for the quarter ending December. The analyst estimates the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 to hit more than 42 million, while the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 6 ""phablet"" contributed with just over 16 million unit sales.

If the numbers hold up, Apple is in for a record-smashing holiday quarter. Kuo's estimates are well above expectations from other leading investment banks including UBS, which earlier this month forecast Apple to sell 69 million iPhones.

Momentum from Apple's iPhone 6 lineup will spill into the first quarter, driving overall iPhone shipments to an about 61.7 million unit sales. A performance of that caliber would buffer seasonally slow sales.

Consistent with the latest reports, Kuo also expects the highly anticipated Apple Watch to launch in March. While Apple has stayed mum on exact specifications, the company could fill in the blanks with a special announcement prior to the device's debut, the analyst said.

Assuming a March launch, Apple Watch is expected to sell 2.8 million units in the first quarter, meaning those sales will be spread across a relatively short one-month span. Kuo says most component suppliers will see shipments in the 4 million to 5 million unit range through the March quarter, but a few manufacturers are seeing low yields on key parts, slowing down final assembly and shipping.

On Apple's rumored 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina display, Kuo is forecasting a ship-by date sometime this quarter. The all-new thin-and-light, said to sport a Retina display, ultra-thin form factor and Intel's latest mobile chips, will help fuel a 2.6-percent quarter-over-quarter increase in Mac shipments. Kuo expects Mac sales to hit 6 million units for the first three months of 2015, up slightly from 5.9 million forecast for Q4 2014.

Aside from industry scuttlebutt, not much is known about Apple's ultraportable newcomer. A set of photos posted online yesterday purportedly show the laptop's display assembly, which boasts edge-to-edge glass with black bezels and eschews the usual translucent Apple logo for a polished insert more in line with the latest iOS devices.

Finally, Kuo sees drooping sell through for iPad as Apple's recently released iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 models largely failed to move the needle during the holiday season. For the December quarter, estimates put iPad shipments down 17.8 percent year-over-year to 21.4 million units. Moving into the first quarter of 2015, iPad could hit 10.1 million unit sales, but the number is still weak, down 38 percent compared to the same time last year.

Interestingly, Kuo models a rise in shipments for older iPad versions during the March quarter while at the same time revising down previous estimates of iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3. The analyst adjusted his numbers to reflect challenges Apple's tablet is facing with shifting market headwinds."

Derek Nash and his partner, who live in Torpoint, discovered the ‘no show fee’ invoice for £15.95 in their son’s school bag last week.

Mr Nash, a delivery driver, said he “thought it was a joke”.

Alex's parents fear they may be dragged into a court battle - all because their son chose a day out with his grandparents over a pal's birthday party

Just before the Christmas holidays, Alex, their son, was invited to a classmate’s Birthday party at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre.

Alex, who goes to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School, told his parents he wanted to go and so Mr Nash and his partner confirmed he would be at the celebration.

Mr Nash said: “She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.”

But Mr Nash later realised he had arranged for Alex and his sister Lily to out for a day trip with their grandparents.

“By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy’s mother] know,” explained Mr Nash.

“So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do; he chose to be with his grandparents.”

On January 6 Alex went back to school as the new term got under way.

Mr Nash continued: “My partner looked out for [the friend’s mother] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn’t see her.

“But on January 15 she looked in Alex’s school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for £15.95 for a child’s party no show fee.

The bill Alex brought home. He was not charged VAT on his birthday party no-show...

“I asked Alex’s class teacher if [the child’s mother] had given anything to her. She said, ‘Yes, a brown envelope’.

“I then visited Alex’s school headteacher, who couldn’t apologise enough that one of the teachers had passed this on.

“She said she would remind all staff that this was a breach of protocol.”

“I left the school and went to see [the birthday boy’s mother] as her address was on the invoice.

“When she answered the door I told her I had found the invoice in my son’s school bag and that I wasn’t happy about it.

“I told her I would not be paying her the money.

“I told her she should have spoken to me first and not put the invoice in my son’s school bag.”

He added: “I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up, but I just can’t believe the way she has gone around it.”

The couple claim that the mother of Alex’s friend has threatened the couple with taking the case to the small claims court.

And five-year-old Alex has told his parents that his classmate will no longer play with him after he didn’t show up to the party.


Poor Alex says his friend will no longer play with him at school since the row broke out

Mr Nash said: “I drive all around the South West for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this.

“They’re all quite incredulous that this has happened.

“I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words.”

Mr Nash’s partner has been in contact with the mum via Facebook hoping to resolve the situation.

The mother of Alex’s friend was unavailable for comment when contacted by The Herald.


Full Facebook conversation between Alex's mum Tanya and the birthday boy's mum Julie.

Tanya Walsh

Hi Julie. This is Alex's mum. I don't know what has happened between you and my partner, Derek. I was very shocked to see the invoice in Alex's school bag. I did not realise that you had to pay for each child, as you never mentioned anything about money when we spoke. The only reason Alex did not attend the party was because his nan and grandad were going away for christmas and the only day the kids could go see them was on the same day as the party. I did not know this. On the day Alex decided that he wanted to spend time with his nan and grandad. I apologise for not letting you know, but I did not have a phone number or an e-mail for you to let you know the situation(I also didn't know your first name, or I would have looked you up). If I had known that I would have to pay if Alex did not go, then I would have paid you the money, no problem. I do not like fighting with people, and would prefer to settle this amicably.

Julie Lawrence

Hi Tanya, I didn't mention the money when we spoke because it was a child's party, it doesn't matter if you have to pay per person or for a group if people agree to going, I confirmed that with all parents on the Thursday before the party that they were going as I had to pay that day, and Derek told me Alex was looking forward to it and would see us there, to me that is confirmation. My phone number was on the invitation that was sent out to Alex. I don't like fighting with people either, and was not best impressed when Derek turned up on my doorstep, and said you won't get any money out of me, rather rudely, I do admit it rattled me. This is not the first time Alex has not turned up to a party that he has been invited to, either. the amicable way round this I believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt, I hope this is agreeable ? Julie

Tanya Walsh

Hi Julie, who's party is Alex supposed to have gone to? I did speak to another mum about a party but she never got back to me with details, other than that I don't recall any other confirmed invites. The only reason Derek was angry was because of the fact that the envelope was put into Alex's school bag, when it has nothing to do with the school. He spoke to the headteacher about and she said that it's against school policy to do that kind of thing. Birthday invites are fine, but not personal items. Like I said before, no money was mentioned when we spoke, and I feel it would be inappropriate to pay you the money, when I don't know what it's actually paying for. Alex was very excited to go to the party. I didn't know until the day about his nan and grandad, and he decided he would rather spend the day with them. Like I said before I didn't have your number to let you know. And exactly what lesson would I be learning. I am not a child, so please do not speak to me like I am one. So, to answer your question, unfortunately no. This is not agreeable.

Julie Lawrence

You are paying for 1 x child's party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch, to with you said Alex was attending on the Thursday

Tanya Walsh

Just so you know, small claims court cost #60 just to start a claim. Also I'm not paying for something we didn't use.

Julie Lawrence

It doesn't cost that much

Tanya Walsh

It does. Also I don't think the school are very happy with you involving them in this either. I don't know why you are out for our blood and slandering us. I've told you the reasons why alex didn't go. I also told you why I couldn't call. You also don't seem to understand that I never ran away from you. I didnt hear you calling after me. I have to get to my daughter at carbeile. So if they let alex out last then I have to rush a bit because evie, my 2 year old, walks slow. So maybe that's why you thought I was rushing off. I had no reason to run to run away from you. So please do not state things as truth when you do not have all the facts. Maybe if you actually spoke to me rather than making your own mind up about what happened then none of this would be happening right now. If you had come up to us the first day back and explained about the money, then I could have explained about alex, then maybe we could have sorted something out. Instead you send an invoice."
1244,"The Tampa, Fla. woman who claimed to have had plastic surgery to add a third breast is fake, according to TMZ.

The woman, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, was reportedly discovered to have faked the plastic surgery after TMZ obtained a police report filed by Tridevil after her bag was stolen at Tampa International Airport.

TMZ reports that the bag was stolen off of an American Airlines conveyor belt and a ""3 breast prosthesis"" was found inside by police after they recovered the bag.

Buzzfeed initially reported the woman's strange look landed her appearances on ""Inside Edition"" and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" but FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

In trying to further track down the story, we did find Tridevil's real name and cell phone number, and we gave her a call, but so far have not received a reply to our voice mail message.

Which is a shame, because we have several questions to ask about her unique tale.

Tridevil said in a recent radio interview that she got the surgery “a few months ago” and had a very hard time finding a doctor who would agree to her request.

“They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it,” she said. “I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it.”

She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she wouldn’t reveal his identity. She said paid $20,000 for the purported surgery.

Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV."

1248,"Looks like he used up all his nine lives!

A cat in Florida that was hit by a car and then buried is apparently back from the dead.

""I was so shocked,"" owner Ellis Hutson told ABC News. ""I didn’t know really what to do.""

And today, Bart the cat is having surgery at the Humane Society to repair his jaw and remove his eye.

Meet the Guy Delivering Food to Snowed-In New Yorkers
Unleashed 'Polar Bear' Delights Residents
""We have seen many amazing cases at our full-service veterinary clinic, but this situation may take the cake,"" the Humane Society of Tampa said on its website.

The cat's owner, Hutson, 52, said he found Bart the cat two weeks ago in the middle of the road, lifeless in a puddle of blood.

Hutson said he asked his friend to help bury the 23-month old cat, because the landscaper was so distraught after losing a companion he's had since he was a kitten.

""We were so close, I couldn’t stand to bury him,"" Hutson said. ""I put him on the shoulder of the road and went and got David. He dug a hole and covered up the cat with dirt. I witnessed him bury the cat.""

Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbor's yard alive, but weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention.

""I open the door and my neighbor's standing there with the cat in her hand,"" Hutson said. ""She said, 'Bart is not dead.' I said, 'That’s impossible. We buried Bart.'""

Bart has been treated for a broken jaw, open facial wounds and a ruined eye. The Humane Society veterinarians expect him to recover and be able to return home after recovering a couple days.

""This is unbelievable. I don’t have any explanation for it,"" Hutson said.

Hutson said he will pay for the surgery costs for the cat. The total cost for the care of Bart, including today’s surgery and post-operative care, will be around $2,000, the Humane Society said.

Hutson's neighbor Dusty Albritton started a GoFundMe page to raise money for the cat’s medical expenses.

“I saw him with my own eyes. I know he was dead. He was cold and stiff,” Albritton told ABC News.

Albritton’s cat died the same day with similar injuries.

“We figured he was hit by the same car,” she said.

“Now my kids believe their cat will also rise from the dead,"" she said with a chuckle. ""But I told them I don't think so.""

When she discovered the resurrected Bart, she said he acted “like he’s in no pain whatsoever.”

“The only thing I can think of is that this is God’s miracle. And I thought, why five days later? If Bart was alive before, he would have come to our homes earlier. All I can think of is that God created animal life on the fifth day.“

Bart was a kitten from Hutson's girlfriend's cat. He said this has been an emotional ordeal for him and his girlfriend, but he hasn't tried explaining the situation to his two-year old daughter.

""As a two-year old, she doesn't understand any of this either,"" he said."
1250,"BEIRUT (AP) - An Internet video purports to show the beheading of U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State group.

Sotloff, who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, had last been seen in Syrian in August 2013 until he appeared in a video released online last month by the Islamic State group that showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley.

Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against the backdrop of an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the group in Iraq.

In the video distributed Tuesday and entitled ""A Second Message to America,"" Sotloff appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an Islamic State fighter.

A Florida native, Sotloff grew up in Miami. He graduated from Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, N.H., where he received a journalism award, according to Manchester TV station WMUR. He went on to attend the University of Central Florida.

1257,"A woman in China is facing jail time for slicing off her 3-year-old nephew’s penis in anger.

Xue Paan was babysitting her nephew, 3-year-old Qiang Qiang, while Qiang’s mother – Paan’s sister – went to visit neighbors nearby.

Reports indicate that Paan was sitting on the toilet texting her boyfriend when the toddler burst into the bathroom and asked if he could play games on her smart phone.

The toddler’s question reportedly sent Paan into such a rage that she went to the kitchen, grabbed a blunt knife, and completely severed the screaming child’s penis.

The 37-year-old woman then allegedly fled the scene. Qiang’s mother heard his screams and rushed back the apartment.

“I had popped out to see a neighbor and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream,” Qiang’s mother said.

Inquisitr reports that the child had apparently fainted and was lying in a pool of his own blood when his mother arrived; a knife was next to his severed penis.

Qiang’s mother recalls that she “couldn’t believe what I saw.”

The young boy was rushed to the hospital, where surgeons managed to reattach his penis. He was then sent to a specialist in Beijing.

A hospital spokesperson told reporters that, although the boy’s penis was reattached, “it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment. However, he has now had three surgeries, all of which have been successful, and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.”

Paan was arrested. She admitted to attacking the boy because she was angry that “he had interrupted her on the toilet.”

She now faces up to five years in jail for the attack."
1259,"Dead or alive? Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Photo: AP

Beirut: The fate of the self-proclaimed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi remains unclear, with rumours that he was wounded in a US air strike in Iraq still unconfirmed.

The United States Central Command said coalition aircraft did conduct a series of airstrikes on a convoy in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul where it is thought there was a gathering of Islamic State leaders.

It is believed there were at least 50 casualties from the attack.

However Colonel Patrick Ryder, a spokesman at Central Command, said: ""We cannot confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present,"" the Guardian reported.

One of Baghdadi's key aides, Abdul Rahman al-Athaee, is known to have died in the attack and as he was known to travel with the leadership it has prompted a raft of speculation as to the well-being of Baghdadi.

A Twitter account purported to be run by an IS spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, appeared to confirm the self-declared caliph had been injured.

""Perhaps you suspected that the caliphate ended with martyrdom of the caliph. I assure the [Islamic] nation that the Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is well thank God, and I wish him a speedy recovery.""

However commentators have cast doubt on those comments, with some labelling the Twitter account a fake.

Two people who say they witnessed an airstrike on a house near the western Iraqi border town of al-Qaim where senior Islamic State officials were meeting told Reuters the militants had evacuated a local hospital so their wounded could be treated.

Meanwhile, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official told Associated Press on Sunday that the strike on al-Qaim in Anbar province had wounded Baghdadi, while a senior Iraqi military official also said he had heard Baghdadi had been wounded in the attack.

Baghdadi's last public appearance was in a mosque in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in July, in which he declared himself the leader of a new caliphate that stretched from Syria into Iraq.

One commentator and author, Juan Cole, cautioned against placing too much hope that – should the death of Baghdadi be confirmed – the Islamic State would be weakened.

""The US has killed a long line of al-Qaeda leaders by now, from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in 2006 to Bin Laden himself,"" Mr Cole wrote on his Informed Comment blog on Sunday.

""The military's theory that leadership is rare and attrition wrought on leaders is decisive in defeating a group is simply incorrect. ISIL's toolbox of terrorising and coercing people is available to large numbers of people.""

Britain's chief of defence staff, General Sir Nick Houghton, also warned that Islamic State would regroup if its leader had been killed.

Speaking to the BBC, General Houghton said: ""What I wouldn't want to do is rush to the sense that the potential death of one of their totemic leaders is going to create some strategic reverse within [IS].

""They will regenerate leadership … because of the current potential attractiveness of this warped ideology. Unless we get the political dimension of the strategy in place, then [IS] has the potential to keep regenerating and certainly regenerating its leaders."""
1264,"Argentina’s president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves.
President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.
He was adopted as a godson under a law passed in the 1920s. The law was passed in order to counteract a legend that led to the death of Argentine boys. According to the legend, the seventh son, born after six boys without any girls in-between, becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf.
The belief in the legend was so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.
The law only applied to the biological children of Catholic families until the enacting of a presidential decree in 2009, which allows children from other religions to qualify.
The boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until his 21st birthday.
Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree, and asking for the designation of godson.
Yair Tawil on Tuesday became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina’s history. Fernandez received the Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together on a Hanukkah menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family.
The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers the “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”
She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.
Shlomo Tawil is the director of the Chabad House in Rosario, located in central Argentina"

The Human Society of Tampa Bay released a statement to ABC, explaining what happened to Bart after his owner discovered that he had been hit by a car:

""The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbors yard, alive!""

How does the Humane Society believe the cat pulled off the feat? It wasn't easy, even for this resilient little guy.

""He had dug himself out of the grave and slowly made his way back home, albeit in weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention,"" the society explained.

He had wounds on his face, a broken jaw and a ruined eye. The owner couldn't afford vet treatments, so the cat was taken to the Humane Society, which is now taking care of him.

Unfortunately Bart still has a long road ahead of him. He is unable to eat because he is in so much pain. Tuesday he will undergo surgery, when the society will wire his jaw, repair his palette, insert a temporary feeding tube and remove his damaged eye.

There is good news, though, for Bart the miracle cat: The society believes he will be at home recovering soon.

Bart is at the Human Society of Tampa Bay right now, and rescuers told FOX 13 that he has severe trauma to the head, a broken jaw, a dead eye, and other injuries. Right now, doctors are scheduling surgery to save its life.

FOX 13 visited Bart on Monday. Rescuers say they believe he may have regained consciousness, dug himself out of the ground, and hid for a few days.

They say he's likely to live, but he will lose his eye.

1285,"A 19-year-old from Brighton is reportedly among five British jihadis killed in the American airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria.

The mother of Ibrahim Kamara learned of her son's death through social media after the US strikes on the country - primarily aimed at Islamic Sate - on Tuesday, The Guardian reported.

An image was posted to Facebook - which has not been verified - that apparently shows Kamara in an unzipped body bag.

News of Ibrahim Kamara's death reached his mother by social media

If it is confirmed, he is among the first Britons killed in Syria by US action.

Kamara, who was known as Khalil al-Britani, is thought to have been fighting for al Nusra, an affiliate group of al Qaeda, is believed to have been one of five men killed in a drone strike on Aleppo.

His mother Khadijah Kamara, 35, told The Guardian her son rang her in February to say he was in Syria and she hung up.

When he rang again, she told him: ""Don't ever call me again.""

After his death, she said: ""I cried when I could not do anything about it.

""I cried then. What's left to cry now? I have three other boys, I have to be strong for them.""

She told ITV News: ""I knew something like this (would happen), if someone's in a warzone area.""

When asked about how she felt about her son being in Syria, she said: ""I've always been angry inside. I couldn't believe it, I couldn't believe a member of my family could even think about this kind of thing.""

She said she was angry at people who ""brainwashed"" her son and the airport for allowing him to travel to the warzone on his 15-year-old brother's passport.

""Who would let someone travel on a 15-year-old's passport? It was not his passport yet he got away with it. I will never figure this out.""

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ""We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Syria."""
1286,"A massage therapist claims to have undergone plastic surgery to obtain a third breast.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) says she had the surgery “a few months ago” and is now hell bent on starring in her own reality TV show.

The 21-year-old has hired a camera crew to follow her around and hopes to pitch her show to MTV. Writing on her Facebook page, she says she has upcoming appearances on the Jimmy Kimmel show and the Inside Edition.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

Of the controversial surgery, she told Real Radio 104.1 she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the procedure.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

Of the one who agreed to carry out the operation, she claimed: “He made me sign a non-disclosure agreement as he was scared he’d get in trouble.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

Tampa resident Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says her parents have not taken the news of her transformation well.

She said: “My mum ran out of the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad… he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil says the surgery cost $20,000 and that included a “nipple” implant. She claims to have had an areole tattooed around the nipple after the surgery.

Looks familiar: The three-breasted woman first made an appearance in 1999's Total Recall

She also revealed: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.

“Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”

Um, right.

Tridevil’s bold new look is of course reminiscent of that infamous scene from the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

Kaitlyn Leeb reprised the role in the 2012 remake of the film

Upon meeting a prostitute with three breasts, one enamoured suitor exclaims: “Baby, you make me wish I had three hands!”

The film was remade in 2012, and yes, the three-breasted woman made another appearance.

Toronto-based model and actress Kaitlyn Leeb took the role and even decided to display her (prosthetic) triple cleavage at a Comic Con event.

We think you’ll agree Leeb’s prosthetics are pretty convincing – could it be that Tridevil simply followed suit and hasn’t been under the knife after all?"
1309,"The United States government said early Wednesday that the video showing the murder of journalist Steven Sotloff at the hands of an Islamic State militant is authentic.

According to the Twitter page run by President Barack Obama's National Security Council:

The US Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing US citizen Steven Sotloff & reached judgment it is authentic.

— @NSCPress (@NSCPress) September 3, 2014

The video, which was discovered on Tuesday by the SITE Intelligence Group, showed Sotloff being beheaded in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. Prior to the slaying, Sotloff was shown kneeling on the ground and wearing orange clothing, a scene that was reminiscent of the Islamic State murder of American journalist James Foley two weeks ago.

The masked militant on the video warned President Barack Obama that as long as U.S. airstrikes against the militant group continue, ""our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."" He also threatened the life of David Haines, a British citizen and aid worker, who was kidnapped in March 2013.

Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelancer for Time magazine and Foreign Policy, was abducted in 2013 while covering the civil war in Syria.

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Sotloff's murder a ""despicable crime,"" the BBC News reported.

Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement Wednesday, calling the killing of Sotloff ""unfathomable"" and ""an act of medieval savagery by a coward hiding behind a mask.""

""When terrorists anywhere around the world have murdered our citizens, the United States held them accountable, no matter how long it took,"" he said. ""And those who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no matter how long it takes.""

The woman, who is unnamed because she is underage, is said to have poured a bottle of acid onto Humphrey Khoza's penis while he was out watching a soccer game with his friends in Mpumalanga, South Africa.

""Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle but I didn't realize that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realized that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex,"" Khoza reportedly said.

Khoza is sticking with the story that he never planned to release the video of him and his girlfriend of less than two months, and that he has no idea how it ended up on the Internet in the first place, which is all well and good except now he can't use his penis. He reportedly must now pee from a tube and undergo surgery.

Still, Khoza won't press charges: ""Even if I press charges it is useless because it won't bring back my manhood,"" Khoza said. ""Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts.""

His last public appearance was on September 3, when he was spotted with a limp.

South Korean news agencies claim he also suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure.
Kim's grandfather Kim Il-sung reportedly had gout, which is a type of arthritis.

It can affect any joints but is most common in the big toe.

Gout is more common in men and attacks, which usually last between five and 15 days, can go away on their own.

But if left untreated it can lead to kidney stones and cardiovascular disease.

1354,"In the latest iPhone refresh, a lot changed. In addition to the screen size uptick, the overall design of the phones changed, bringing a more well-rounded (punny!) form factor, and slipping us away form the squared-off design of iPhones past. Still, one thing remained unanswered: how would Apple treat the smaller iPhones moving forward? The iPhone 5C is near its end of cycle, and the iPhone 5S will likely disappear next year. A new rumor suggests Apple is going to come back strong with a new 4-inch phone to replace them.



As we heard they might ahead of the iPhone 6 launch, a new (well, not sure I can really say that, but you get the point) iPhone is rumored to check in next year. With a 4-inch screen, it will keep Apple rooted to its one-handed past while we double-tap the home button to shrink screens on the larger phones.

The questions surrounding this are why, and how. Why would Apple create an entirely new -- but still smaller -- iPhone? How will they market it? Is it an emerging market flagship, or a budget-friendly offering for the US?

Let’s also keep in mind this is a rumor, and comes via a source we’re not familiar with. The “new iPhone” could even be an iPod refresh, instead of the “female friendly” iPhone the Chinese source claims.

As the Apple TV becomes more smart-home hub than streaming box, I’ve long held the position that a robust remote with the ability to run apps is a good idea, and the iPod fits that purpose nicely. Still speculative, but I’d much rather that than a new, small iPhone."

Fan Lung, 32, was reportedly caught cheating with a younger woman after he used his wife's phone to send a message to his lover and ineptly forgot to log out afterward. His enraged wife, Feng, lopped off his dick with a pair of scissors, but doctors were able to reattach it after he was rushed to the hospital.

But Feng followed him, snuck into his hospital room while he was recovering from surgery, and cut his dick off again. And then, for good measure, she threw it out the window.

""The two subsequently clashed outside the facility, with a naked and bleeding Fan repeatedly beating his wife, until onlookers called the police,"" according to an AFP story.

The photos above allegedly show that fight.

It was sad, sad fate for Fan Lung's penis, which wasn't recovered, but a happy ending for Fan Lung, who will reportedly marry his mistress anyway.

""It doesn't matter if he turns out to be infertile, he has five children anyway,"" she's quoted as saying.

The legend of the double dismemberment comes from government-owned Chinese news agency HNR, which picked it up from China's hugely popular Twitter-like social network, Sina Weibo.

The story hasn't been entirely debunked, but it's dubious at best. Hoax-tracking site emergent.info points out that the Weibo account credited for the original photos has either been deleted or never existed at all.

Dornella Conner says she was at a gas station in the St Louis suburb in a car being driven by her boyfriend when an officer fired a non-lethal ‘bean bag’ round at them as they tried to drive away, showering her with glass

Police, who were responding to reports of gunshots in the area, said that the officer fired at the car because it was being driven towards him and he feared for his safety – but Conner claims that he had no need to use a weapon on them.

She told Kmov.com: ‘I didn’t have any weapons, I wasn’t looting or anything. I was just out with my boyfriend. We was just riding around respecting Mike Brown.’

Conner told the news channel that several police vehicles had blocked their exit from the gas station ‘from the side and the back’.

Conner has lost sight in her left eye and has blurry vision in the other following the incident on Tuesday at New Halls Ferry Road

A non-lethal bean-bag round

A bean-bag round, or flexible baton round, is a projectile used by law enforcement officers to incapacitate suspects without killing them.

They are fired from a shotgun and take the form of lead shots housed in a small 'pillow'.

They are designed not to penetrate skin, but are capable of causing muscle spasms.

Deaths from bean bag rounds are rare. They have killed people in the past by causing internal bleeding, breaking the neck and even fatally damaging the heart by sending pieces of broken rib into it.

Shotguns with bean-bag rounds are normally colored bright orange to prevent lethal rounds being loaded.

Conner’s father, Donnell, said he was ‘very disappointed at police tactics’. He added: ‘There was no reason to fire upon an innocent person who was sitting in a vehicle.’

Her sister, who goes by the name Tikal Goldie, said: ‘I really just want to have closure and justice for my sister.’

Meanwhile, dozens of people have interrupted holiday shopping at major retail stores around the St. Louis area to speak out about a grand jury's decision not to indict the officer who fatally shot Michael Brown.

The protests began Thanksgiving night and continued early Friday. Protesters spent a few minutes at each store, shouting inside as law enforcement stood watch. There was no immediate word of any arrests.

According to Johnetta Elzie, who had been tweeting and posting videos of the protests, demonstrations occurred at a Wal-Mart and Target in Brentwood, two Wal-Marts in St. Charles and one Wal-Mart in Manchester.

In Ferguson, where Brown was shot on August 9, it was a quiet holiday night. There were no visible protests as the National Guard patrolled the area.

Earlier thousands of Walmart employees threatened to walk out from stores across the country on the biggest shopping day of the year.

Days after a grand jury decided not to charge officer Darren Wilson, demonstrators have led a campaign not to visit stores the day after Thanksgiving.

The group has used hashtags on social media such as #HandsUpDon'tSpend, in reference to the death of the teen in August, and #BlackOutBlackFriday.

Some demonstrators showed up outside Macy's in New York as crowds gathered to get an early jump on the sales.

Others in Ferguson walked through a Target store with their hands up, as unrest continued followed the controversial decision earlier this week.

1381,"The NHL may be set to expand in a big, big way.

Sports Business News reported late Tuesday the league is preparing to add four teams by 2017 in Toronto, Quebec City, Seattle and Las Vegas.

Expansion fees could reach a combined $1.4 billion.

The number of NHL teams would increase to 34, including nine Canadian clubs.

Earlier Tuesday, a report in the Vancouver Province, citing sources close to the situation, said an expansion team in Sin City was a “done deal” and the only thing yet to be determined is who will front the ownership group.

The report also indicated any expansion plans might include more than two teams.

In May, Las Vegas officials broke ground on the building of a 20,000-seat multi-sport arena to be completed in spring 2016.

Construction on a $400 million, 18,000-seat arena in Quebec City is underway with a projected opening date of Sept. 2015. The rink is being built as part of a public-private partnership between the city and Quebecor Media, owner of QMI Agency, Sun Media and Sun News Network.The league has routinely denied any plans for expansion in recent years.

In spite of that, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly have reportedly had several meetings with city officials and potential ownership groups in Seattle.

Bettman has in the past admitted to receiving interest from groups in Seattle, Las Vegas, Kansas City and Quebec City.

“We’re listening, and that’s all we’re doing,” Bettman said in March. “We haven’t decided to engage in a formal expansion process at this point, but we’re listening. There is a lot of interest, and some of that’s a testament to the state of the game right now.”

The league last expanded in 2000 with the addition of the Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild."

Hewlett-Packard is planning to split into two companies as it looks to put more focus on the faster-growing corporate services market, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The move, which could be announced on Monday, would be a monumental reshaping of one of technology’s most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112bn (£70bn) in revenue this fiscal year but has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing.

Under the reported plan, HP will separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations and spin the unit off through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year.

A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.

HP’s printing and personal computing business accounts for about half its revenue and profit, according to last quarter’s financial results. It is not clear how many of HP’s staff –about 300,000 people – work in each of the planned businesses.

Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a garage in Palo Alto, California in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the personal computer revolution. Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing and has been overshadowed by younger rivals.

HP’s market value of $66bn is dwarfed by Apple Inc’s $596bn and Microsoft Corp’s $380bn.

It has also been overtaken by aggressive Chinese computer maker Lenovo, which is now the world’s number one, based on shipments. Dell, which is HP’s closest US competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year."

1411,"No one knows exactly where he came from. No one knows why he was chosen to lead the Islamic State. And now, in the past 24 hours, reports have arrived saying Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is “believed dead,” or merely wounded, or “critically wounded,” or unscathed — or possibly not even at the scene of the attack.

Following U.S. airstrikes targeting Islamic State commanders attending a clandestine meeting over the weekend, few reports agree on the facts. Meanwhile, American commanders can’t or won’t say whether or not he was even there or not, let alone hurt.

The drama and ensuing confusion is fitting for Baghdadi, a shadowy figure whose myth may only be enhanced by the mystery surrounding his purported demise.

The saga deepened on Sunday when Iraqi Defense Minister said on Facebook that Baghdadi’s deputy was killed and that the self-described caliph was injured in the attack. Then Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said to be the Islamic State’s spokesman, dispatched his own update. “Perhaps you suspected that the Caliphate ended with martyrdom of the Caliph,” the Jerusalem Post quoted him saying. “I assure the [Islamic] nation that the Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is well thank god, and I wish him a speedy recovery,” the implication being that he was at least injured.

If so, he would have escaped a fate that claimed other prominent Islamic leaders. The assassinations began in 2006. That year, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of an earlier iteration of the Islamic State, was killed when U.S. warplanes dropped two 500-pound bombs on a house in which he met with other insurgency figures. Four years later, an Iraqi-American operation unleashed a barrage on a building in Tikrit, Iraq, killing the group’s top two leaders and ushering in the tenure of an unknown figure named Baghdadi.

Not surprisingly, those killings made Baghdadi risk-averse and even more inclined than other militant leaders to a life inhabited in the shadows. But while the leader’s aversion to the public eye has protected Baghdadi, it has also allowed facts to melt into Islamic State propaganda, forging an identity that has become one of the most potent recruiting devices at the Islamic State’s disposal.

The pitch: Baghdadi is a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, holds a doctorate in Islamic studies and envisions a Sunni-dominated caliphate that spans continents. It’s a carefully crafted story that separates the Islamic State from nearly every other Islamic militant movement — evidenced when fighters of the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda offshoot battling in Syria, wanted to defect to the Islamic State. All they had to do, reported the New York Times, was make a few phone calls, pledge allegiance to Baghdadi and their new life would begin.

The mystique of Baghdadi, experts suggest, would make him all the more difficult to replace and his loss all the more significant. “The wounding and potential loss of Baghdadi may be of more significance for his followers” than adherents of other jihadist groups, wrote Theodore Karasik, senior adviser to the company, Risk Insurance Management: “Baghdadi, as ‘Caliph Ibrahim,’ to maintain his religious foundation, needs to be of a whole body. If he loses a limb in his injuries, his credibility suffers. If he dies, the death would toss the entire concept of the legitimacy of the ‘Caliphate’ on its head.”

Using another name for the Islamic State, Karasik added: “ISIS discourse will likely need to be revised.”

So if Baghdadi survived the American bombardment, he may retreat further into darkness. That’s where he’s most comfortable operating, reported the Soufan Group: “He is intensely careful about his security … when commanders below the leadership level were called to meet him, it is said that they would be told he was present in the group but without his identity being specified.” Other reports said he wears masks when meeting prisoners to obscure his identity, earning the nickname of the “invisible sheik.”

When Baghdadi delivered a sermon from a mosque in Mosul on July 4, 2014, it marked the first time many people had gotten a good look at him. Before that appearance, there had only been two confirmed pictures him. And such “obscurity,” a Soufan report said, “may have provided [him] an advantage.”

Indeed, tracking his movements has been difficult in the black hole of Syria, where U.S. officials fumble around without a stable of contacts and intelligence services available in Iraq, according to a Foreign Policy report. “The same thing is needed to hunt down Baghdadi,” Thomas Sanderson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the magazine. “When you kill the leader, it demonstrates that anyone is vulnerable.”

Making the challenge more difficult: The Islamic State has altered its tactics. U.S. airstrikes have forced it hide its fighters among local communities and cities, Foreign Policy said, and stop moving its soldiers in large convoys. “They have gone to ground inside cities and this makes decapitation strikes very difficult,” David E. Johnson, a Rand military expert, said. “You can’t kill them if you can’t find them.”

And few are more difficult to find than Baghdadi."

It's important to note that Kuo has a stellar track record when it comes to Apple, which means this is likely more than just a rumor.

1421,"The tradition to stop stigma about the 'lobison' has continued for a century

The President of Argentina has adopted a young Jewish man as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.

President Christina Fernández de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family at her office last week to mark the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years.

According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared “el lobison”.

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

Fear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys – an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption, aimed at stopping the deadly stigma.

Starting in 1907, the tradition was formally established by a decree in 1973 by Juan Domingo Peron, which also extended the practice to baby girls.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera

Seventh sons or daughters – now much rarer than 100 years ago – gain the President as their official godparent as well as a gold medal and full educational scholarship.

Even now, reports of dog-like creatures attacking livestock continue, as does the tradition.

Ms Fernandez said Yair is the first Jewish boy to be adopted, as the tradition only applied to Catholic children until 2009.

A wedding punch-up was sparked when a bride opted to marry a guest instead after her husband-to-be had an epileptic fit during the ceremony.

Jugal Kishore, 25, and 23-year-old bride Indira were about to perform the traditional 'varmala' ceremony during their Hindu wedding, when he suddenly fell ill.

Kishore fell to the ground as he extended his arms to exchange garlands with his bride.

But Indira, angry that her family had not been told of Kishore's epilepsy, decided to marry one of her wedding guests instead...Harpal Singh, her sister's brother-in-law.

Singh and Indira exchanged garlands in the traditional way in front of the guests, as Kishore, was taken to a doctor for treatment.

When he returned to the wedding venue, he found that his wife-to-be was now married to someone else.

Kishore pleaded with Indira, to change her mind, but she stood firm - sparking a punch-up between guests, involving spoons, plates and dishes, the Times of India reports.

Police in Rampur district of India, said they had detained several people who were there at the wedding.

""Both families have amicably resolved the matter,"" an officer said.

""The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad.""

1440,"This plot was too crazy even for Charles Manson.

Manson’s engagement to a woman 53 years his junior was part of a wild scheme of hers to profit by putting his body on public display after his death, says the author of an upcoming book.

Manson’s fiancée, 27-year-old Afton Elaine Burton, known as Star, sought to wed the convicted mastermind of the Sharon Tate murder and eight other slayings so that she could gain possession of his corpse, according to journalist Daniel Simone.

Burton and a pal, Craig Hammond, planned to lay out Manson’s remains in a glass crypt, Simone says. The pair figured their bizarre California version of Lenin’s Tomb would draw huge crowds and make big money.

But Manson, 80, does not want to marry Burton and has no interest in spending eternity displayed in a glass coffin, Simone told The Post. “He’s finally realized that he’s been played for a fool,” Simone said.

Another reason the madman balked at the plan is because he believes he is immortal. “He feels he will never die,” Simone said. “Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.”

Manson’s and Burton’s marriage license expired Thursday. “They plan on renewing the license, and things will move forward in the coming months,” says a statement posted on Burton’s and Hammond’s website.

Burton and Hammond — who uses the nickname Gray Wolf — could not be reached for comment.

The wedding was postponed “due to an unexpected interruption in logistics,” the site says. Manson entered a prison medical facility for treatment of an infection about two months ago and cannot receive visitors, Simone said.

California prison officials would not comment on either Manson’s medical condition or his whereabouts.

Simone and a collaborator, Heidi Jordan Ley, are seeking a publisher for their book, “The Retrial of Charles Manson.” Manson and other inmates at Corcoran State Prison in California are helping the project. The authors say they spoke with Manson regularly before his phone privileges were suspended two years ago. They also corresponded with Manson and his inmate friends by mail.

According to the authors, Burton and Hammond hatched their plan to display Manson’s corpse about two years ago.

Initially, the duo asked Manson to sign a document that would let them take his body when he dies.

“He didn’t give them a yes, he didn’t give them a no. He sort of strung them along,” Simone said. Burton and Hammond regularly brought Manson toiletries and other items. Stringing them along kept the goodies coming, Simone said.

When it became clear last year that the purportedly death-proof Manson would not green-light the plan, Burton and Hammond switched to the marriage idea, Simone says.

If Burton married Manson, the pair realized, California law would give her possession of Manson’s remains upon his death, Simone said.

Simone believes Manson never intended to marry Burton. “Manson never consented to the wedding in the first place and never will,” he said.

Another Simone book, “The Lufthansa Heist,” about a $6 million armed robbery at Kennedy Airport in 1978, is due out next month. He co-authored it with “Good­Fellas” mobster Henry Hill, who died in 2012."
1444,"(Updates with victim killing scorpion) By Kevin Murphy Feb 15 (Reuters) - A scorpion stung a passenger on an Alaska Airlines flight to Portland, Oregon, delaying a flight that originated in Mexico, the carrier said on Sunday. Flight 567, which originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, was taxiing for takeoff on Saturday at Los Angeles International Airport when the woman was stung, airline spokesman Cole Cosgrove said. The plane returned to the gate, where medics treated the woman and offered additional medical treatment, which she declined, Cosgrove said. She did not get back on the plane, he said. Passengers stayed on board, he said. The woman brushed the scorpion away after the sting and killed it on the floor with her foot, Cosgrove said. The crew of the Boeing 737 checked for other scorpions and the plane departed about 50 minutes late, he said. ""We don't know exactly how the scorpion made it on the plane, but the flight did originate in Los Cabos, Mexico, where scorpions are known to live,"" Cosgrove said. The airline was reaching out to the woman on Sunday regarding possible compensation for her inconvenience and to check on her condition, Cosgrove said. Only about 30 of about 1,500 species of scorpions can cause potentially fatal stings, according the website of the Mayo Clinic. ""Scorpion stings, although painful, are mostly harmless,"" a clinic posting said. (Reporting by Kevin Murphy in Kansas City; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Eric Walsh)"
1451,"Just after 12 pm on Tuesday, a story started picking up some serious online momentum.

In the span of about an hour, it appeared on the websites of The Week, Elite Daily, the Daily Mirror, the New York Post, Mediaite, an ABC affiliate, among others.

Here’s how the New York Post’s story began:

Even bears can’t stand Justin Bieber’s music.
A fisherman in Russia was being attacked by a brown bear and escaped death when his Justin Bieber ringtone went off and sent the beast fleeing into the forest.
Animals? Check. A strange and amazing turn of events? Check. Justin Bieber angle when he’s already in the news for a run-in with Orlando Bloom? Check.

Too good to check? Check.

But next thing you know, NPR’s “Morning Edition” covers it, and it ends up in a Seth Meyers monologue:

Here’s the issue: the first story of the bear attack was published in Russian language publication Pravda back on July 31 — and it says nothing about Justin Bieber.

At some point in making the leap to English, someone added a detail to the story that transformed it into a viral hit. According to Google Translate, the original Russian version said the bear was scared away when Igor Vorozhbitsyn’s phone began speaking out the current time. So, yes, the phone apparently scared off the bear mid-mauling. But no Bieber.

Did Vorozhbitsyn change his story in a subsequent interview and realize it was Bieber all along?

Or did someone insert a seemingly false Justin Bieber angle into the story?

Point of Bieberfication

The bear-and-Bieber stories all carried the same pictures of Vorozhbitsyn. They had the same quotes of him explaining that his granddaughter had put the ringtone on his phone.

They quote the same “wildlife expert”: “Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear.”

Hey, thanks for that too-perfect quote to round out the story, anonymous wildlife expert with no credentials!

The symmetry in the stories is because they all used the information contained in a single English language report from a site called the Austrian Times. It’s led by a Brit named Michael Leidig, who also owns the Central European News agency. (His name is listed in the domain owership records for the sites, as well as for CEN’s affiliate agency, EuroPics.)

After the Austrian Times/CEN published the story, it spread to MailOnline.

Once MailOnline had it, the story was off and running. Bieber and the bear was the real deal, and everyone wanted to plant a flag on it. As of this writing, MailOnline’s story has racked up over 13,000 shares.

The images are the first clue as to where the story really came from. MailOnline cited CEN as the copyright holder of the image it used. But the Austrian Times story credits Pravda with the image on its story. A search on the Pravda website turned up the original article with its images and Bieber-less reporting.

So how did the Austrian Times learn of the Bieber angle that Pravda apparently missed?

No answer from Austrian Times/CEN/EuroPics

I called the offices of the Austrian Times and first asked to speak with David Rogers, who is the only person listed on the site. (He is both its ombudsman and its primary sales contact.)

I spoke with a woman who said Rogers was not in the office. When I asked about the story, she said she would follow up with their office in Russia to get the details and would call me back. I asked if their office there typically rewrites things from wires and local press.

“A lot of stories are found on the wire or in local media but also from local interviews on the ground, or we speak to the reporters who wrote them; we speak to police to get things confirmed,” she said.

I called her again later that day to ask if she had news from the Russian office, and she said they are often hard to get ahold of. She never got back to me.

I also called and emailed Leidig, owner of both the Austrian Times, CEN and EuroPics. A man who answered the phone at the CEN office said Leidig is on vacation in Romania.

Leidig, who has lived in Austria for some time, says nothing about himself on the CEN or Times websites, but he has an extensive Wikipedia page. In the section about CEN, it lists MailOnline as one of its clients, though that and much of the page itself offers no citation for the claim. (In 2013, Leidig self-published a book about Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff.)

Along with detailing Leidig’s journalistic achievements, the Wikipedia page includes this passage:

Leidig is also a campaigner for greater support for journalism which he describes as the “coalface of democracy.” He has campaigned in favour of more responsibility from search engines like Google to give credit to original source material and also for payment for originators of news, arguing that if the journalists all go out of business nobody will provide the content worth having.
The sole link in that passage goes to… an article on the Austrian Times. Still, one would hope Pravda is therefore earning some revenue from the story and images that CEN and the Austrian Times plucked from its site. (I contacted Pravda to ask about the images and the story, but have not yet heard back.)

For their part, the Austrian Times, CEN and EuroPics have stopped talking to me. After receiving no information from their Russian bureau, I sent a detailed email Thursday with questions about the Bieber version of the Pravda story and its use — and possible resale — of Pravda images.  No has replied or returned my calls.

Meanwhile, the irresistibly Bieberfied version of the story continues to spread. Entertainment websites and news organizations give it the quick rewrite treatment and link to each other’s versions, completely obscuring the dubious origins of the story.

Too good to check, and now, I suspect, too entrenched to ever be really corrected."
1452,"LOS ANGELES (CBS Seattle/AP) — A scorpion stung a woman on the hand just before her flight from Los Angeles to Portland took off.
Flight 567 was taxiing on the runway Saturday night when the passenger was stung, Alaska Airlines spokesman Cole Cosgrove said. The plane returned to the gate, and the woman was checked by medics. She refused additional medical treatment, but she didn’t get back on the plane.
The woman stomped the scorpion to death, and flight attendants checked overhead compartments for any additional unwanted arachnids, Cosgrove said. It’s unclear how the scorpion got on the plane, but the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, where scorpions are common, he said.
The flight then took off at 8:40 p.m., about an hour late.
Members of Oregon State University’s men’s basketball team were on the flight, Cosgrove said.  The team was returning home after losing to USC 68-55.
Oregon State Coach Wayne Tinkle told ESPN that the woman was sitting two rows in front of him.
“The plane was coming from Mexico before us and the scorpion was on the plane,” Tinkle said.  “The woman was a real champ.  She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her, but the needle was stuck.”"
1454,"If you thought three-breasted women were a thing of the “Total Recall"" past, you obviously haven’t heard of Jasmine Tridevil.

The 21-year-old Tampa, Fla. resident allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third breast and fake nipple surgically added to her body in hopes of deterring male suitors and earning an MTV reality show. Needless to say, her parents aren’t too thrilled about it.

“My mom ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me,” Tridevil said of her mother’s reaction. Dad’s a little more supportive but still ashamed of his circus-freak-esque daughter.

From a 10-minute radio segment called “The News Junkie,” it’s pretty clear Tridevil was probably never just your average girl. Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.

Which leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel’s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn’t come cheap. Tridevil said she’s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.

“I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.

Massage therapy isn’t Tridevil’s calling anymore. She’s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.

Tridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what’s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.

“When I give you advice, I don’t wanna hear you give me excuses,” she said in the video.

You tell 'em girl.

“My whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,” she said in the interview. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this,” Tridevil said of the reality show she’s currently producing. “So if this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

1460,"Argentina's President Christina Fernández de Kirchner has a pretty solid plan for keeping her country safe from werewolves: She's going to adopt them.

There's apparently an obscure bit of Argentinian folklore that states the seventh son born to a family will turn into the feared el lobison on the first Friday after the boy's 13th birthday. The myth predicts the child will transform into a creature at midnight during each full moon, eternally damned to ravage the countryside before returning to human form.

Other fun bits of el lobison trivia, per The Independent: They feed on excrement, unbaptized babies and the flesh of the recently dead; they're unnaturally strong; and they can spread their curse by biting.

The fear of el lobison's curse was so strong in Argentina that families abandoned – or in some cases murdered – their seventh son in the 19th century, which is how the tradition of the sitting president adopting one of these children came to pass in 1907. It was formally decreed in 1973 by then-president Juan Domingo Perón, and extended to baby girls at that time. Those adopted gain the sitting president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.




This year, Kirchner adopted the first Jewish seventh son, Yair Tawil. The practice had extended only to Catholic children until 2009. Kirchner met with Yair and his parents, Shlomo and Nehama, on Dec. 23. She called the family ""marvelous,"" described Yair as ""a total sweetie,"" and bestowed the presidential nickname of ""Queen Esther"" on Nehama. (Shlomo and Nehama had sent in their request back in 1993.)"

However, the claims in the story are untrue. No such private information was leaked and there are no credible reports that support the claims.

‘She just angrily called me a dog. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex.’

1486,"Earlier this year, Apple bought Beats Music and Beats Electronics for $3 billion. Since then, CEO Tim Cook has gone out of its way to rave about the Beats Music subscription service, which sells all-you-can-eat music for $10 a month.

So why would Apple plan to shut down Beats Music, as a TechCrunch headline reports?

Answer: It’s not.

Tom Neumayr, says the TechCrunch story is “not true”, but wouldn’t elaborate.

I can elaborate a bit more, based on conversations with people familiar with Apple’s thinking: Apple won’t shutter the streaming service. It may, however, modify it over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music brand.

Note that Apple does seem pretty pleased with the iTunes brand, which was the focus of its controversial U2 album giveaway this month.

Shuttering the Beats Music brand name makes some sense, as the company hadn’t generated a ton of traction before Apple bought it in May — at that time, it only had a few hundred thousand subscribers. On the other hand, the Beats headphone brand, which Apple doesn’t have any plans to dump, has a lot of recognition, so it wouldn’t have seemed bizarre."
1490,"Jasmine Tridevil claims to have had plastic surgery that gave her a third boob, but a cosmetic surgeon is calling her bluff. Even though the addition of another breast is theoretically possible, it is not plausible.

""[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” Dr. Matthew Schulman, a board-certified plastic surgeon in New York, told the Daily Dot. “I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.""

There are two main reasons the doctor is skeptical about Tridevil’s story. The first is the photographic “evidence” of the third breast has been taken by Tridevil and posted on her personal Facebook page. The lighting is dim and the photos easily could have been altered, the Daily Dot wrote.

Second, creating a third breast would require placement of a tissue expander beneath the skin between her two breasts to make a pocket for the false breast. It would take about six months for this to happen and then the spacer could be replaced with an implant. Schulman said multiple surgeries would need be required.

When asked about her surgery, Tridevil simply said she had it done a few months ago. She didn’t mention anything about an expander or how long it took for the surgery.

The final bit of evidence that suggests Tridevil’s third breast is fake was the final result. “This technique would create a tight, round breast in the center of the chest,” he said. “Also, all three breasts will likely be connected because it would be impossible to create and maintain separation between all three round structures. The photos show a soft, pendulous breast that is clearly separate from the right and left breast. She essentially has a hanging breast, and it is just not reflective of what we would be able to expect from this reconstruction procedure.”

During a radio interview, Tridevil refused to give her real name but Snopes pointed out she has a “striking” resemblance to Alisha Hessler, the person to whom JASMINETRIDEVIL.com is registered.

Hessler made headlines in 2013 after she publicly shamed a man who allegedly assaulted her, Snopes wrote. She reportedly made a man hold a sign that said “I beat women.” She withdrew her complaint with the police department after she was asked for details about the alleged attack, Buzzfeed wrote.

Tridevil said on her Facebook account Tuesday Alisha Hessler is her real name. She also said the news story is real and she was arrested for using someone else’s identification to get into a club. “I was underage and wanted to get drunk lol,” she wrote.

She told The Sun her claim is not a hoax and her film crew recorded her procedure. She said she will release the footage when she gets a reality television show and “I really don’t care what people say about me.”

1495,"BEIRUT — The ISIS terror group has published a video titled “A second message to America,” showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

The video also threatens the life of British captive David Haines.

Sotloff speaks to the camera before he is killed, saying he is “paying the price” for U.S. intervention.

The masked ISIS figure in the video speaks to President Barack Obama, telling him, “Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.”

Last week, Sotloff’s mother Shirley Sotloff released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi not to kill her son.

“Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson,” she said. “He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak.”

Sotloff appeared last month in an ISIS video showing the decapitation of another American journalist, James Foley. The militant in the video warned that Sotloff’s fate depended on what President Obama did next in Iraq.

Steven Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013, but his family kept the news secret, fearing harm to him if they went public.

Out of public view, the family and a number of government agencies have been trying to gain Sotloff’s release for the past year.

Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians like the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies like “Lawrence of Arabia” and “The Big Lebowski” as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a “stand-up philosopher from Miami.”

In 2004, Sotloff left UCF and moved back to the Miami area.

He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and the Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey — among other countries — and eventually Syria.

Sotloff’s killing likley will step up pressure on Obama to devise a strategy to combat ISIS.

On Friday, Obama said it’s too soon to discuss what steps the U.S. would take against the militant group inside Syria. On how to deal with the group in Syria — where it was born and has a safe haven, mostly in the city of Raqqa — the president said: “We don’t have a strategy yet.”

Obama said Friday that he has asked America’s top defense officials to prepare “a range of options.”"
1497,"The woman who became a poster girl of Kurdish resistance in the city of Kobane is actually alive, contrary to rumors spread by members of ISIS, who claimed to have beheaded her.

The woman, who went by the name Rehana, was seen as an image of hope in the city as it fought ISIS forces. An image of her giving the peace sign while dressed for battle went viral, making her an international symbol. Just two days ago, though, ISIS militants claimed to have captured Rehana and killed her by beheading. They sent photos of members holding her head high, alongside the ISIS flag.

Friends of Rehana have come forward to put an end to the rumors and state that Rehana made it out of Kobane and is living in southern Turkey, alive and well.

""She is my friend and I confirm that she is alive,"" an anonymous source told MailOnline. ""And the picture of [the] beheaded female fighter is not Rehana's picture. She is in Turkey. I will try to gain her number because I lost connection with her. She evacuated Kobane and I stayed in Kobane. At the beginning of the last clashes, Rehana left Kobane.""

Right now, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are battling for control of the border town; Syrian Arab rebels have arrived in order to provide the Peshmerga with support. The U.S. has also provided air support, reportedly destroying five ISIS fighting positions and six vehicles. The Peshmerga and Syrian rebels apparently need further support, though it's unknown if they will be able to receive it in time to save the city of Kobane.

""The only way to help Kobane, since other countries don't want to use ground troops, is sending some peace-oriented or moderate troops to Kobane. What are they? Peshmerga … and Free Syrian Army,"" Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told the BBC.

Meanwhile, news of Rehana's safety has reached Syrian/Kurdish journalist Rashad Abdel Qader, who noted that she was ""fighting fiercely.""

Isis fighters are reportedly just one mile away from Baghdad as reports emerge of al-Qaeda militants bolstering their ranks in Syria.

According to the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East, Isis was approaching the Iraqi capital on Monday morning.

""The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad,"" a spokesperson said.

""They said it could never happen and now it almost has. Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be here a very short while to know they can do very very little.""

Isis fighters were also battling Government forces in a key town 25 miles west of Baghdad - Amiriyat al-Fallujah.

According to a BBC correspondent, fighting had calmed by Monday afternoon but a standoff continued along the main road to nearby Fallujah, which is under Isis control.

The extremists had been advancing towards the capital but were held off by bombing and Iraqi ground forces.

US air strikes overnight targeted other Isis positions in Anbar province, the Pentagon said, and in Syria four more oil fields controlled by militants near Raqqa were hit on Sunday.

American officials called the attacks “successful” but the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed mostly civilians were hit and a grain silo was destroyed.

The news comes amid reports of an emerging alliance between Isis forces in Syria and Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Nusra Front.

The group is the Syrian offshoot of al-Qaeda and has been fighting against the Assad regime in the civil war.

Despite months of clashes between its forces and Isis (also known as Islamic State) militants, the two groups appear to be forming a loose coalition in parts of the country to fight increasing attacks by the US and its allies.

Al-Nusra’s official spokesperson, Abu Firas al-Suri, threatened the coalition nations with retaliation on Saturday.

“These states have committed a horrible act that is going to put them on the list of jihadist targets throughout the world,” he said.

“This is not a war against al-Nusra, but a war against Islam.”

Al-Nusra and Isis leaders are now holding war planning meetings together, a source told the Guardian, although no formal alliance has been confirmed.

The reports follow growing defections from other Islamist groups to Isis, which is seen as better organised and equipped to create an “Islamic State” straddling Iraq and Syria.

A loyalty pledge was reportedly made by al-Nusra in June in the town of Al-Bukamal near the Iraqi border, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, and the two groups have fought together against Government forces.

The report appeared to be confirmed on Twitter by a photograph showing an Egyptian al-Nusra Front commander shaking hands with an Isis leader of Chechen origin.

Although both Isis and al-Nusra are rooted in al-Qaeda, the two have been rivals since Isis started its involvement in Syria’s civil war in spring last year and have engaged in bloody battles killing more than 3,000 militants from both sides.

A merger had been declared by Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2013, when Isis was known as al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), but the alliance was rejected by al-Nusra and overruled by al-Qaeda leader al-Zawahiri.

But the international response to Isis’ bloody rampage through Iraq and Syria, and the beheadings of British and American hostages, is pushing the groups towards an alliance.

An al-Nusra source told Reuters: “There are hardline voices inside Nusra who are pushing for reconciliation with Islamic State.”

A formal alliance is believed to only be possible on the orders of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.

A deal between the militant groups would strengthen the Islamist force in Syria as air strikes cripple Isis funding sources, equipment stores and slow its advances.

The US has not said al-Nusra is being targeted but its planes have attacked a new group called Khorasan, which some analysts suspect is part of al-Nusra.

The two groups have been known to co-operate and Khorasan is believed to be made up of veteran al-Qaeda fighters with battlefield experience mostly in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Britain, the US and the United Nations are among those who have classed al-Nusra as a terrorist group, citing its use of suicide bombing, terrorist attacks and attempts to impose Islamic law.

A small number of anti-Government groups, including some members for the secular Free Syrian Army, opposed the label after al-Nusra gained respect fighting the Assad regime."
1525,"Late comedian's personal physician allegedly performed an unauthorized biopsy, causing a heart attack

Joan Rivers' personal doctor took a selfie in the operating room while performing an unauthorized throat biopsy during the procedure that led to the comedian's death, according to CNN report on Tuesday.
A staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia,"" an unnamed source close to the death investigation told the cable news network.

However, the clinic has denied previous media accounts of the spontaneous biopsy. ""A biopsy of the vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy,"" a rep told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement on Sept. 12. Yorkville's medical director, Lawrence B. Cohen, has been forced out of his position on the board and is no longer performing procedures there. He also left his private-practice group, New York Gastroenterology Associates.

Rivers went to Yorkville Endoscopy for a routine procedure when complications arose. She was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. Rivers died on Sept. 4, at age 81. After an initial autopsy, the New York City medical examiner's office has said the cause of death is unclear and they need to run more tests.

Yorkville Endoscopy, Dr. Cohen's office and the medical examiner's office did not immediately return emails for comment."
1526,"A woman in Henan province has been arrested for reportedly chopping off her husband's penis after discovering that he was having an affair—then going to the hospital and cutting it off again.
The husband and father of five, 32-year-old Fan Lung, had used his wife's phone to send a steamy email to his mistress, 21-year-old Zhang Hung, from his home in the city of Shangqiu, The Mirror reports.
Fan had forgotten to log out of his account, and when his wife Feng, 30, looked through her phone, she found the message among several others that he'd sent to to his xiao san. In a fit of rage, Feng grabbed a pair of scissors and chopped off her husband's penis while he was sleeping in their bedroom.
Fan was taken to a hospital, where doctors were able to reattach his precious manhood. Feng, however, managed to sneak into his hospital room and cut his penis off again before tossing it out of a window, The Mirror said.
""The first [time] we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital,"" a hospital spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.
""Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.""
They brought the fighting couple back into the hospital and discovered that Feng had cut off her husband's newly reattached member.
Doctors and police searched outside for the man's severed penis, but to no avail. They believe it was carried off by a stray animal.
Fan, who'd lost a lot of blood at this point, is now in stable condition after undergoing emergency surgery but is ""extremely emotionally distraught,"" as one might expect.
Fan's side-lover, however, said she still plans to marry him.
""It doesn’t matter that he’s lost his fertility, he has five children already,"" she was quoted as saying.

1527,"TechCrunch reports that Apple plans to shut down Beats Music, the streaming music service that it acquired earlier this year. The blog's Josh Constine says that he's confirmed the news with five sources at both Apple and Beats. And to be honest, it makes sense.

It seems very unlikely that Apple is going to abandon streaming music altogether. If true, news that Beats Music is dying reads as a clear indication that Apple is going to create its own streaming service or simply expand iTunes Radio. Constine agrees:

Considering Apple's penchant for simple, unified brands, and how it despises fragmentation, shutting down Beats Music makes a lot of sense. Running a second music service in parallel with iTunes that forces people to learn a whole new interface might have confused customers. Beats Music's CEO Ian Rogers was also put in charge of iTunes Radio, meaning he's already splitting his time rather than just focusing on Beats Music.

Based on images of the home screen, Constine adds, it looks like Apple's readying a new music app just for the new Apple Watch. People thought the company's music app for wearables would be Beats Music. And maybe it sort of is on the back end! It just won't be called Beats Music.

News of the split was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. On Monday, HP disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it would proceed with the plan, which is expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal year 2015.

“Our work during the past three years has significantly strengthened our core businesses to the point where we can more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,” said HP chief executive Meg Whitman said in a press release. “The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan.”

A Florida feline has been dubbed a “zombie cat” after clawing his way out of an untimely grave. The cat's owner, Tampa resident Ellis Hutson, 52, told ABC News he found his pet, Bart, in the road a couple of weeks ago.

Bart, who seemed to have been hit by a car, was in a pool of blood and Hutson says he was sure the cat was dead.

Because he and the animal were “so close,” he says he couldn’t bear to bury the cat himself. He enlisted the help of his neighbor and watched him put Bart to rest … or so he thought.

Days later, a bedraggled Bart -- who had apparently dug himself out of the ground --  made his way to another neighbor’s yard, Fox 13 reports.

""I open the door and my neighbor's standing there with the cat in her hand,"" Hutson told ABC. ""She said, 'Bart is not dead.' I said, 'That’s impossible. We buried Bart.'""

Hutson rushed the cat to the hospital, where Bart was treated for injuries including severe head trauma, a broken jaw and a dead eye.

Veterinarians at the Humane Society of Tampa Bay expect Bart to fully recover and be able to return home, although he will lose one of his eyes.

1561,"Saudi Arabia's national airline is allegedly planning to separate male and female passengers on its flights, in accordance to strict rules enforced by the Gulf kingdom.

Gulf media report that Saudia will keep men and women segregated onboard, unless they are close relatives.

The move follows a spate of complaints from male fliers unwilling to allow other males to sit next to their wives and other female family members.

National carrrier Saudia will keep men and women segregated onboard, unless they are close relatives

Complaints were also recently made when male passengers claimed a flight attendant was being too 'flirty'.

'There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,' Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, told Saudi daily, Ajel.

It is thought that the airline will include instructions to flight booking staff at Gulf airports to keep these new rules in place.

The carrier's policies are already in tune to the strict Islamic practices of Saudi Arabia: no alcoholic beverages or pork dishes are served onboard, a prayer of verse from the Quran is read before take off, and many international flights have a designated men's prayer area.

In addition, Saudia does not employ Saudi women as cabin crew, opting to recruit women from other countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines, Albania and Bosnia instead.

But moves are being made to employ females on the ground in November, the airline opened its fourth women's section staffed by entirely by females at its office in the Murooj district of Saudi capital, Riyadh.

There are no alcoholic beverages or pork dishes are served on board.

The country is known for its gender segregation, with women requiring a male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home.

In public spaces such as restaurants, beaches, amusement parks or banks, women are required to enter and exit through special doors.

Women who are seen socialising with a man who is not a relative can even be charged with committing adultery, fornication or prostitution.

The majority of Gulf operated airlines abide by Islamic laws, but vary over strictness.

For example United Emirates carrier, Etihad's new A380 aircraft includes a prayer area in Business class, but the new cabin crew uniform, launched last month, does not feature a veil.

Chief Commercial Officer, Peter Baumgartner, told MailOnline Travel: ‘Modern Arabia is what is going on in Abu Dhabi, we are inspired by what’s going on in the rest of the world, but through the lens of the local DNA.

1566,"FERGUSON, Mo. (CBS St. Louis/AP) — A pregnant woman lost her eye during protests in Ferguson early Tuesday morning after a St. Louis County Police officer fired a bean bag round at the car she was in, shattering the glass on the passenger-side window.
Dornella Conner told KMOV-TV that she and her boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, were at a gas station early Tuesday morning during the protests following a grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson in the Aug. 9 shooting death of Michael Brown. Conners claims that they were trying to drive around the officers’ cars, but they blocked them in.
“They pulled up while we were coming towards the street. De’Angelas was trying to get away. They blocked us from the side, front and back,” Conners told KMOV.
Police, though, tell the station that Lee was driving his car toward them and that’s when an officer fired a bean bag round at the car, which shattered the passenger-side glass where Conner was sitting.
“I didn’t have any weapons. I wasn’t looting or anything. I was just out with my boyfriend and we were just riding around and respecting Mike Brown,” Conners said.
Conner sought medical attention from another police officer before she was taken to a hospital. The shattered glass left her blind in her left eye.
“I’m very upset and very disappointed with tactics that they used on trying to get control of the situation that was going,” Donnell Conner, Dornella’s father, told KMOV. “I understand it’s a tough job, I understand that it was chaos, but there was no reason to fire upon an innocent person that’s sitting in a vehicle.
“How can a pregnant person in a car in a seatbelt be causing chaos?”
Dornella Conner took to Facebook to thank her family and friends for their support.
“[I’m] blind in my left eye and they took it out because I got shot in my face so I can only see in my right eye, but thank God that i can see the world and still alive,” she wrote. “I’m in a lot of pain but I’m ok.”
KMOV reports that an arrest warrant has been issued for Lee and a bond has been set at $50,000. Sixteen people were arrested on the gas station lot located on the 10000 block of Halls Ferry Road on Tuesday.
Despite the violence this week, protesters in Ferguson pressed pause Thursday as the city welcomed Thanksgiving, decorating boarded-up storefronts with some Dr. Seuss inspiration and gathering for church services — a stark contrast to previous days of outrage over the grand jury decision in the Michael Brown case.
No police officers or Missouri National Guard members stood sentry outside the Ferguson police station, which has been a nexus for protesters since Monday night’s announcement,
On that downtown street, beneath a lighted “Season’s Greetings” garland, three children used paintbrushes to decorate the plywood covering many storefront windows that was put up to foil potential vandals. One quoted from “The Lorax” by Dr. Seuss: “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better, it’s not.”
“We thought we’d do what we could to make it a little more attractive and then try to bring the kids into it and get them involved in making the businesses appear a little less scary, depressing,” said Leah Bailey, as her 7-year-old son Dennis climbed a ladder to finish an orange dragon.
Several hours after dark, a few people continued painting, but there was no visible protest activity. National Guard troops occasionally patrolled the area and surrounding neighborhoods in vehicles and on foot.
Since the grand jury’s decision, protests have taken place across the country. Most have been peaceful. But at least 130 demonstrators who refused to disperse during a Los Angeles protest were arrested Wednesday night, while 35 people were detained in Oakland following a march that deteriorated into unrest and vandalism, according to police officials.
Back in Ferguson, Greater St. Mark Family Church sits blocks from where several stores went up in flames after the grand jury announcement. A handful of people listened to the Rev. Tommie Pierson preach Thursday that the destruction and chaos was by “a small group of out-of-control people out there.”
“They don’t represent the community, they don’t represent the mood nor the feelings of the community,” Pierson said. “I would imagine if you talked to them, they probably don’t even live here. So, we don’t want to be defined by what they did.”
In downtown St. Louis, a group gathered near Busch Stadium for what organizer Paul Byrd called a “pro-community” car rally meant to be peaceful and counter the recent Ferguson violence he suggested has tarnished the region’s image.
Byrd, a 45-year-old construction worker from Imperial, Missouri, declined to say whether he supported Wilson but noted, “I totally support police officers.” The cruise was escorted by a city police vehicle; no protesters showed up.

China's Lenovo could make an offer to acquire the Canadian smartphone maker as early as this week, ""a source familiar with the matter"" told Benzinga.

Lenovo expressed interest in buying the Waterloo-based tech titan last year, but the Canadian government told the Beijing-based computer manufacturer it would not allow a Chinese takeover, citing national security concerns.

This time could be different, however, because Lenovo announced the creation of a new company focused on the internet of things, a space which BlackBerry has shown emerging interest in. That new company, slated to launch next year, would operate under a separate name and brand.

According to Benzinga, Lenovo would hope to acquire BlackBerry for approximately $18 a share, or just under double the company's current stock price."
1591,"The Beats Music brand could be singing its last tune.

According to a report published by TechCrunch, Apple has begun to wind down the streaming music service that it acquired in May, with many of its staffers already moved onto other projects at Apple. ITunes is said to be one of them.

Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers already has been put in charge of iTunes Radio, with the Beats Music technology likely to be integrated into that service, sources say.

Beats Music has not been heavily promoted during Apple’s recent product demonstrations, including the launch of its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as well as its Apple Watch.

In fact, the new smartphones do not include Beats Music pre-loaded as an app — an unusual move and sign that Apple has other plans for Beats Music’ technology. U2’s free album was offered through Beats Music.

While the Apple Watch, out next year, will include a music app, Beats Music wasn’t mentioned during its launch demo.

The confusion two separate music services could generate among consumers is said to be one of the reasons Apple is making the move to close Beats Music. Apple also had shut down another streaming service, Lala, after acquiring it.

While Apple isn’t expected to entirely do away with Beats Music, the company is rethinking whether to still operate it as a separate brand, sources also confirmed to Re/Code.

While Beats Music has the Beats headphone brand helping put it in the spotlight, the service has struggled to compete against more established online players like Spotify, Pandora, Rdio and Google Music.

It had just 111,000 paying subscribers in March, and 250,000 in May, according to Jimmy Iovine. That’s compared to 10 million for Spotify.

Beats Music was part of the $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics Apple made in August.

Apple and Beats have not commented on the potential shuttering of the service.

Apple is having to take a close look at its iTunes business as digital music sales fell 13.3% in 2013, whereas streaming grew 32% last year in the U.S."
1596,"Reports Monday said that Islamist fighters for ISIS, the Islamic State, which has already conquered large areas of Lebanon and Iraq, are at the gates of Baghdad. Despite the aerial attacks being carried out by the US and its allies, the group's fighters have been steadily progressing, and are said to be barely a mile from the city. The report in the Independent newspaper, published in London, quoted officials of the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East.

According to the officials, Islamic State terrorists could basically enter the city at will, as there is little substantial defense to prevent them from doing so. ""The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad,"" the spokesperson said. “They said it could never happen and now it almost has. [US President Barack] Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do,"" the report quoted the spokesperson as saying.

Obama indeed made that admission Sunday night, in an interview broadcast on CBS news program 60 Minutes. “Over the past couple of years, during the chaos of the Syrian civil war, where essentially you have huge swathes of the country that are completely ungoverned,"" the president said, Islamic State was ""able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos.

""This became ground zero for jihadists around the world,"" Obama said of Syria, where Islamic State now controls territory in the east around on the city of Raqqa. “Where you've got states that are failing or in the midst of civil war, these kinds of organizations thrive,"" he said.

In a separate development over the weekend, the head of the Syrian Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra Front said that it would work with Islamic State to defeat the “Western infidels,” reports said. ""Muslims will not watch while their sons are bombed. Your leaders will not be the only ones who would pay the price of the war. You will pay the heaviest price,"" he said, warning that the battle would be brought ""to the hearts of your homes,” said Al-Nusra head Abu Mohamad al-Golani. ""You should protect yourselves from this war by standing against the decisions of your rulers and stop them from bringing you the woes (of war),"" he added, according to Reuters.

""We are in a long war. This war will not end in months nor years. This war could last for decades,"" group spokesman Abu Firas al-Suri said.

""It's not a war against Nusra Front, it's a war against Islam,” he added.

IS and the Al-Nusra Front share the same ideology and rigid Islamic beliefs, but they fell out during a power struggle and have been battling each other this past year.

Nusra Front is now coming under pressure from its own members to reconcile with Islamic State and join forces to fight what they describe as a ""crusader"" campaign against Islam.

Al-Nusra Front, whose leader pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri, has been heavily involved in the fighting in Syria as well as in neighboring Lebanon, where it has claimed responsibility for several bombings and has also threatened local Sunnis.

Most recently, members of the group kidnapped 45 Fijian UN peacekeepers and threatened to try them under Islamic law before ultimately releasing them."

Iga Jasica, 19, was receiving treatment at Central Clinical Hospital in Katowice, Poland, for a cancerous growth on her brain. According to the Mirror, Jasica awoke during the surgery after the anesthetic she had been administered wore off.

Jasica’s brain was exposed as she verbally communicated with the doctors, asking them how the surgery was going. Her tone was apparently casual, and she wasn’t disturbed by waking up during the procedure.

“Despite coming round she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger,” said Neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz, who explained that the girl couldn’t see or feel anything during the operation.

Jasica remained optimistic about her experience in the operating room, mostly acknowledging her gratitude that the surgery was successful.

“I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great,” Jasica said.

According to Fox News, doctors at the hospital are investigating whether or not the anesthetic was improperly administered prior to Jessica’s operation.

1607,"Johannesburg - Children are being forced to imitate real dog fights, with bets placed on which child would cause the most injuries through biting and scratching, The Star reported on Monday.

A school in Springs, Ekurhuleni requested the help of Inspector Wendy Wilson from the National Council of SPCAs in June, according to the report.

The school's principal, who was not named to protect the identity of the children, was concerned that pupils returned from break time with torn clothing and injuries, Wilson told the newspaper.

Teachers discovered that the children fought each other in dog-fighting role-play, while other pupils placed bets on who would win.

The children were doing this reportedly because adults encouraged them during weekends to take part in actual dog-fighting as well as role-playing.

""They rip into each other. The play is aggressive enough to cause each other injury,"" Wilson was quoted as saying.

Other children placed bets of between R2 and R10.

""The winner of the fight then gets to mate with a younger child as reward,"" Wilson told the newspaper.

She was not sure whether this role-playing moved on to actual copulation.

The Gauteng education department said it was made aware of the allegations early last year.

""The department had contacted the SPCA to request their intervention,"" spokesperson Phumla Sekhonyane was quoted as saying."
1609,"Iraqi officials said Sunday that the head of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was wounded in an airstrike in western Anbar province. Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such an attack or on the militant leader being injured.

Iraq's Defence and Interior ministries both issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without elaborating, and the news was broadcast on state-run television Sunday night.

The reports came at a time when U.S. President Barack Obama said the U.S.-led coalition was in a position to start going on the offensive against the ISIS militants.

Al-Baghdadi, believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force.

He has positioned himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community. His forces have seized large parts of Syria and Iraq, killed thousands of people, beheaded Westerners and drawn the U.S. troops and warplanes back into the region, where Washington is leading a campaign of airstrikes by a multinational coalition.

An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was wounded by an Iraqi airstrike that came during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim. The official cited informants within the militant group. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

U.S. also targeted ISIS leaders in weekend strikes

The operation was carried out by Iraqi security forces, both officials said, although they did not know how seriously al-Baghdadi was hurt. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential material.

A statement posted Sunday on the official Facebook page of Defence Minister Khalid Obeidi also said al-Baghdadi was wounded, but added that he was targeted in the northern city of Mosul, currently the group's biggest stronghold in Iraq. A senior U.S. defence official said Saturday that the coalition conducted a series of airstrikes targeting a gathering of ISIS leaders near Mosul, but he could not confirm whether al-Baghdadi was part of the gathering.

Reports circulated Saturday that al-Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike, but there was no confirmation at that time from either U.S. or Iraqi officials.

The U.S. Central Command said Friday it conducted two airstrikes near Qaim that destroyed a militant armoured vehicle and two checkpoints of the militant group, which is also known by the acronyms ISIL and ISIS. On Nov. 1, the U.S. military conducted four strikes in the town.

When asked about the Iraqi reports, Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder, spokesman for U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, said Sunday: ""We have no information to corroborate reports that ISIL leader al-Baghdadi has been injured.""

Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said some ISIS militants wounded in the airstrike near Qaim were taken across the frontier to the Syrian border town of Boukamal.

""They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital,"" Abdurrahman said.

There was no indication that al-Baghdadi was among those brought to Boukamal.

'They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital.'
- Rami Abdurrahman, director of Syrian Observatory for Human Rights
The reclusive al-Baghdadi is known to have made only one public appearance, purportedly delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul, as seen in a video posted online in June. That came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.

Since then, part of the Islamic State group's core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as more than just a fighting force. In parts of Syria under its control, the group administers courts, repairs roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in Mosul and in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology.

As his forces swept across northern and western Iraq in June and July, they seized towns, causing several of Iraq's army and police divisions to fall into disarray in the worst crisis in the country since U.S. troops withdrew in 2011.

Obama OKs more ground troops in Iraq

On Friday, Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, which could boost the total number of U.S. forces to 3,100 and spread advisory teams and trainers across the country, including into Anbar province where the fighting has been fierce.

The militant Islamist group has overrun a large part of the province in its push to expand its territory, which stands at about a third of both Iraq and Syria. Last week, hundreds of men, women and children with the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe were killed by the militant group, which apparently feared the tribe would challenge its authority in the province.

Kurdish Peshmerga fighters shoot toward Baretle village, which is controlled by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), on the edge of Mosul, Iraq, on Sept. 8. Iraqi soldiers, joined by militia groups and backed by U.S. airstrikes, are fighting to keep the Sunni jihadist group from continuing its violent expansion across the region.

Officials with the Iraqi government, as well as officials with the coalition targeting the extremists, repeatedly have said that Iraqi tribes are key elements in the fight against the Islamic State group since they are able to penetrate areas inaccessible to airstrikes and ground forces.

In an interview with CBS' Face the Nation that took place Friday and was broadcast Sunday, Obama said its airstrikes, which the U.S. first launched on Aug. 8, have been effective in scaling back the Islamic State group's advance.

""Rather than just try to halt ISIL's momentum, we're now in a position to start going on some offence,"" Obama said.

""The airstrikes have been very effective in degrading ISIL's capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making,"" he added."
1616,"When a South Korean woman invested in a robot vacuum cleaner, the idea was to leave her trustworthy gadget to do its work while she took a break from household chores.

Instead, the 52-year-old resident of Changwon city ended up being the victim of what many believe is a peek into a dystopian future in which supposedly benign robots turn against their human masters.

The woman, whose name is being withheld, was taking a nap on the floor at home when the vacuum cleaner locked on to her hair and sucked it up, apparently mistaking it for dust.

The agony of having her hair entangled in the bowels of the contraption roused the woman from her slumber.

Unable to free herself, she called the fire department with a “desperate rescue plea” and was separated from the robot’s clutches by paramedics, according to the South Korean newspaper the Kyunghyang Shinmun.

She escaped serious injury, although it is not known whether she has retained the autonomous cleaner’s services.

Robot vacuum cleaners have grown in popularity in recent years, with US firm iRobot’s circular Roomba selling well over 10 million units in the 12 years since its debut in 2002.

Panasonic recently unveiled Rulo, a triangular rival to Roomba that the Japanese firm says is more adept at sucking up dust from corners.

The wheeled gadgets are equipped with sensors that enable them to steer clear of obstacles, avoid tumbling down stairs, and detect dust and other debris on the floor. They can also be programmed to seek out a recharging dock.

Korean Biz Wire pointed out, however, that people from cultures in which it’s commonplace to sit or nap on the floor - such as Japan and South Korea – may be more vulnerable to vacuum robot rage."

1620,"Officials in Baghdad and Washington remained unclear on Sunday about the fate of the Islamic State (Isis) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after a key aide was killed in a US air strike near Mosul.

A senior Iraqi official confirmed to the Guardian that the aide, Abdur Rahman al-Athaee, also known as Abu Sajar, was killed in the the attack late on Friday night, which hit a 10-car convoy southwest of the Isis stronghold.

Athaee was known to have been in almost constant contact with Baghdadi and officials deduced that his presence in the convoy likely meant that Baghdadi was with him.

However, monitoring of the group’s communications in the aftermath of the attack has revealed nothing to suggest that Baghdadi was killed. Officials have not ruled out that he may have been injured.

“We’re still looking at it very closely,” said an Iraqi intelligence official. “There’s nothing yet, and as time ticks on it may be less likely.”

Jihadist forums have remained mute since the strike took place. The death of Baghdadi would be difficult to keep quiet even among the tight discipline of Isis, which has proven difficult for Iraqi, or international agencies, to penetrate ever since it changed the modern face of the Middle East in June when it made rapid territorial gains in Iraq and seized Mosul, the country’s second largest city.

Iraqis officials claimed to have killed two senior Isis members on Saturday in a raid they carried out on the town of al-Qaim near the Syrian border. The raid took place on a house where senior leaders were meeting and is thought to have killed the overall leader of Anbar province, Adnan Latif al-Suweidi, and Isis’s leader in the Euphrates valley, Bashar al-Muhandi. Both held senior leadership positions in the organisation.

Targeted raids, carried out by the US and its Arab allies in the region, have proven effective in slowing the momentum of the group, according to Iraqi officials and one senior Isis member.However, they have failed to curtail its strategic aims.

The air strike near Mosul came hours after Barack Obama said he would double the number of US troops deployed to Iraq to reinforce the offensive against Isis. On Sunday, the US president said the troop surge will place the US on the front foot as it confronts the group.

In his first public comments since his surge announcement, Obama denied it represented a failure of early reliance on air strikes and said the deployment announced on Friday night “signals a new phase” in his campaign against Islamic State – known as Isis or Isil.

“Rather than just try to halt to Isil’s momentum, we are now in a position to start going on some offensive,” he told Face The Nation on CBS.

“The airstrikes have been very effective in degrading Isil’s abilities and slowing the advances they were making, now we need some ground troops, Iraqi ground troops, to start pushing them back.”

The White House insists the new US troops will be focused on training Iraqis to fight Isis and then co-ordinating air strikes, rather that being involved in what it calls an active combat role.

“What hasn’t changed is our troops are not engaged in combat, essentially what we are doing is we are taking four training centres with coalition members that allow us to bring in Iraqi troops, some of the Sunni tribes that are still resisting Isil, giving them proper training, proper equipment, helping them with strategy, helping them with logistics,” said Obama.

Iraqi forces have performed abysmally since Isis stormed into Mosul on 10 June. In the chaotic two days that followed, up to six divisions fled, surrendering their US-supplied advanced weapons. Since then, Shia militias have increasingly taken prominence in most frontlines across the country.

“We will provide them with close air support once they are prepared to start going on the offensive against Isil, but what we won’t be doing is having our own troops do the fighting,” he added.

But the president also refused to rule out further increases in military engagement in Iraq and Syria, which already include daily bombing raids on Isis in both countries.

“As the commander in chief, I am never going to say never,” he said when asked whether more troops would be sent. “But what the commanders presented the plan to me say is that we may actually see fewer troops over time because now we are seeing coalition members starting to partner with us on the training and assist effort.”

Obama insists this time it will be different because attacks on Isis will only be led by Iraqis.

“What we learned from previous engagement in Iraq is that our military is always the best, we can always knock out any threat, but then when we leave that threat comes back,” he said."
1635,"A wicked aunt cut her three-year-old nephew’s penis off when he burst in on her on the loo and asked to use her phone.

Evil Xue Paan, 37, was sending text messages to her boyfriend while sitting on the toilet when toddler Qiang Qiang walked in and asked if he could play a game on her mobile.

But instead of giving him the phone, the fuming aunt went into the kitchen, picked up a knife and severed the boy’s penis while his mother was visiting a next-door neighbour in Luohe, a city in central China’s Henan Province.

Horrified mum Cai Tuan, 27, said: ""I had popped out to see a neighbour and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream.

""I ran back to the house and couldn’t believe what I saw.

""Qiang Qiang had fainted and was lying in a pool of blood.

""Next to him was a knife and his penis.

""It was simply horrific.

""My sister, his aunt, had gone.""

Qiang Qiang was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach the member and was then sent to a specialist clinic in the capital Beijing.

A hospital spokesman said: ""Unfortunately, the knife was quite blunt and the cut wasn’t clean so although we reattached the boy’s penis, it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment.

""However, he has now had three surgeries all of which have been successful and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.""

A police spokesman said: ""The aunt was arrested and admitted attacking the boy because she was angry that he had interrupted her on the toilet.""

The woman now faces 5 years in jail."
1636,"If the bizarre story about Joan Rivers' doctor pausing to take a ""selfie"" in the operating room minutes before the 81-year-old comedienne went into cardiac arrest on August 29 sounded outlandish, that's because it was.
So says Dr Gwen Korovin, Rivers' personal physician who on Thursday night shot down a CNN report claiming Korovin was so star-struck she took the opportunity of her celebrity patient being unconscious to snap a souvenir photo of the two of them together.

CNN, citing sources close to the investigation being carried out by the medical examiner's office, is standing by its claim that a sedated Rivers was clearly visible in Korovin's procedure room selfie - an allegation Korovin's lawyers are calling ""lies"".

Korovin, (known as the ""patron saint of Broadway singers and actors"" for her work tending to the likes of Lady Gaga, Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Celine Dion, Mick Jagger and Luciano Pavarotti) also ""categorically"" denied performing an unauthorised biopsy on Rivers which, according to multiple published reports, caused the heart attack that killed the beloved New Yorker during what should have been a routine medical procedure.

Whatever Rivers would have made of the escalating drama surrounding her mysterious death, those close to her say she would be thrilled by the news that Vanity Fair scribe Leslie Bennetts has been signed to write her biography, due out early next year.

""Joan Rivers' life story was, in every way, a remarkably dramatic roller-coaster ride characterised by triumphant highs and devastating lows, one that is both wildly entertaining and deeply moving,"" Bennetts said in a statement. ""It's hard to imagine a more compelling subject for a book or one that would be more fun."" And lucrative. Within hours of Rivers' death, sales of her latest book (Diary of a Mad Diva) shot up an impressive - and record-breaking - 70,750pc on Amazon.

Garth Brooks seems to think his Irish fans weren't that put out by the Croke Park debacle. In the run-up to his latest seven-performance run, which kicked off in Atlanta on Friday night, the self-effacing singer-songwriter made reference to his cancelled Irish gigs when asked what the secret is behind his ongoing appeal.

""I wish I could explain it: Of course - I'm beautiful, are you kidding me? I'm talented,"" the 52-year-old joked with reporters. ""But I don't get it...If the Garth guy shows up or not, these guys are still going to have the same great time,"" he said, using his Irish fans as a case in point.

Dowd deals with pot shots

Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Maureen Dowd is on quite a high after learning that she has been cast as the poster girl for a new ""Consume Responsibly"" edible pot publicity campaign.

The 62-year-old New York Times op-ed columnist, who got (unintentionally) stoned last summer while researching a story about Colorado's recent decision to legalise the use of recreational marijuana, doesn't even mind that the pro-pot brigade are making fun of her nightmare experience with cannabis to warn rookies about the dangers of overdosing.

Dowd, who decided to test the benefits of pot with a few bites of a weed-infused chocolate bar wrote about the results (""What could go wrong?"") in a column (titled ""Don't Harsh Our Mellow, Dude"") which was published in June, graphically recalling how - an hour after ingesting the bar, things went haywire.

""I barely made it from the desk to the bed, where I lay curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours... I was panting and paranoid, sure that when the room-service waiter knocked and I didn't answer, he'd call the police and have me arrested for being unable to handle my candy,"" she wrote.

""As my paranoia deepened, I became convinced that I had died and no one was telling me.""

A medical consultant would later tell Dowd that marijuana candy bars ""are supposed to be cut into 16 pieces for novices,"" a point she used to condemn the marijuana industry for promoting the drug without safety precautions for first-time users.

On Wednesday, the advocacy group Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) responded to Dowd's criticism by unveiling a giant billboard featuring a red-haired woman (who looks exactly like the writer) obviously worse for wear on a hotel room bed. ""Don't let a candy bar ruin your vacation,"" reads the tagline. ""With edibles, start low and go slow.""

Dowd, who wasn't in the slightest fazed at her likeness or her story being used in the ad said she has her own plans for artwork from the billboard.

""I'm going to make it my Christmas card. Now,"" she said, adding dryly, ""onto gun control."""

1643,"Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman reportedly plans to split the company in two, becoming chair of a new company with its PC and printer business and CEO of a new company with its corporate hardware and services businesses.

Hewlett-Packard plans to break into two companies in a move that would create separate personal computer/printer and corporate hardware/services businesses, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

The report cited unnamed sources who said the plan could be announced as early as Monday.

The split would be done as a tax-free distribution of stock to shareholders next year, one of the Journal's sources said.

It would be the second big breakup of a Silicon Valley tech powerhouse in a week, following eBay's plan to spin off PayPal. It also comes in the wake of Oracle's announcement that Larry Ellison was handing the CEO reins over to former HP CEO Mark Hurd and Safra Catz.

The move by HP has long been speculated upon and follows the 2011 exploration of a spinoff of the PC business during Leo Apotheker's stormy and short tenure as CEO.

Current CEO Meg Whitman reorganized the company to combine the PC and printer units, which are leaders in shrinking businesses. HP was No. 1 in PCs until last year when it slipped behind China's Lenovo Group Ltd.

The Journal said that Whitman will be chairman of the PC and printer business and CEO of the other enterprise-focused business. Lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company. Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation will be CEO of that business.

HP brought in $55.9 billion in revenue from its printing and personal systems group last year, about half of its total. But sales dropped by about 7.1 percent in the unit, compared to a 6.7 percent drop for the company as a whole."

1655,"KGI Securities' Ming Chi Kuo, one of the most accurate analysts when it comes to predicting Apple's product lineup, says the Apple Watch will be released in March, according to MacRumors.

And, Apple is expected to make some announcements about the watch soon.

This follows previous reports from 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman that also said Apple's first wearable will hit store shelves in March.

Although Apple detailed most of the watch's features back in September, Kuo thinks we'll learn even more about the Apple Watch shortly before its release. Apple will offer more specifics on battery life, Kuo says, which has been a point of contention since the watch was announced.

The company previously said you'd have to charge it nightly, but didn't reveal an exact battery life estimate. Gurman reports that Apple is targeting between 2.5 and 4 hours of active use and 19 hours of mixed standby and active use.

This, however, is just a target and could change by the time the watch is actually released.

Apple will also release information regarding Apple Watch preorders before March, according to Kuo, and the company is expected to ship 2.8 million units in the first quarter of 2015.

1662,"BOURNE, Mass. —The three Afghani soldiers who disappeared during a training exercise at a Cape Cod military base this weekend have been found, a high-level law enforcement source tells Team 5.

The Afghan soldiers had been participating in a U.S. Central Command Regional Cooperation training exercise at Joint Base Cape Cod, U.S. military officials said. They arrived at Camp Edwards on Sept. 11 and were last seen at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis Saturday night.

The source tells Team 5's Karen Anderson the men were taken into custody at the Rainbow Bridge Canadian/US border crossing near Niagara Falls on Monday. The men told Customs Agents they were refugees, the source said.

They were identified as Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar.

""They were here for a multi-national military exercise, which had been scheduled for a long time. They have been here for a couple of weeks. There’s a lot of speculation that within the military they maybe be trying to defect,"" Gov. Deval Patrick said.

The three were among 12 members of the Afghanistan National Army participating in a military exercise that focused on tactical strategies, said Lt. Col. James Sahady of the Massachusetts National Guard.

The Regional Cooperation training exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation and interoperability among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.

This year's exercise, which involves more than 200 participants from six nations including the U.S., wraps up on Wednesday.

Last month, Maj. Gen. Harold Greene was killed by an Afghan soldier in an attack in Afghanistan.

Last weekend, two Afghan policemen in the Washington, D.C., for a DEA training program at Quantico, Virginia, also went missing while on a sightseeing trip to Georgetown, ABC News reported. The DEA said the two men left the group because they did not want to go back to Afghanistan."

1668,"Major Mariam Al Mansouri became the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) first female pilot on the ISIS terrorist group terrorist group following the announcement that the United States would be leading a coalition of nations to use airstrikes against the Islamic State. While the world celebrates her success, the war has come home for Mansouri and reports are claiming the female fight pilot’s family has officially disowned her.

In a related report by The Inquisitr, the 35-year-old Major Mariam Al Mansouri was among three other women that were part of the attack on ISIS. She graduated in January of 2008 and she said that being a military almost entirely dominated by men was a dream she’s held for years.

“It was my aspiration. Ever since I finished high school, I wanted to learn flying because it was something that I liked in the first place. Being in the air force is a responsibility. I feel proud, especially that I am part of the first batch. And that encourages me to continue in this field. As a pilot, you have to study all the time, even after graduation. You have to continue training because the more hours you fly the more experience you accumulate.”

Mansouri led three other UAE F-16 pilots in the first airstrike and it’s said that when the “U.S. tanker pilots called in for air refueling and asked for the UAE mission and when they heard a female voice on the other side they paused for 20 seconds.” They then proceeded to drop bombs this week in coordinated attacks against Islamic State strongholds near Raqqa, Aleppo and Idlib.

Unfortunately, an Arabic language news site called Wattan.TV is reporting that Mariam Al Mansouri’s family has disowned her for these actions. Please keep in mind this is a Google translation and is extremely rough. The Inquisitr did attempt to clean up the translation, but it’s possible there were translation errors introduced in the process.

“The Mansouri family in the UAE announced Wednesday that they had Nbaraha [untranslated] of her daughter Mary because of her participation in the international coalition led by the United States to strike at civilian targets inside Syrian territory. The family also stressed their support for the Syrian revolution. The Mansouri family said in a statement published by news sites Arabic…. ‘We are the sons of the family of al-Mansuri in the United Arab Emirates announce to fill the innocence [translation error?] of the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri. We remind anyone who participates in international aggression on the Syrian people, led by the daughter of the rogue Mariam Al Mansouri, that the the Islamic State in the East and the West has a duty to defend issues of the nation. We exhort the jihad for the sake of Allah and the support of the Syrian Revolution. Blessed, in the face of the descendants of Ibn Alqami.'”

The Mansouri family also called for support for the Syrian revolution, calling for “all factions and battalions operating on the scene Shamiyah to unite and join forces and efforts to a single goal, which is to drop the Assad regime.” The family also appears to have announced support specifically for the ISIS terrorist organization, saying that their family is “honored heroes of the Sunnis in Iraq and the Levant.” The ISIS terrorist group is also known as ISIL, which stands for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, although it’s possible this similarity to the ISIS name may be a Google translation error."

According to the site, the Chinese company is prepared to offer $15.00 a share as an initial offer and finish with a done deal at $18.00 per share.

Moreover, the rumours proclaim the deal will be done as soon as this week. Unsurprisingly, neither company has commented on this rumour.
Optimistic market watchers might point to BlackBerry's re-emergence, care of new CEO John Chen and the new BlackBerry Passport flagship phone. However, the company has still seen a huge decline in its user base and is not in an enviable position compared to cash-rich tech rivals.
Lenovo, for its part, seems to be on a bit of a mobile spending spree. The company bought Motorola Mobility from Google for around $2.91 billion at the start of the year.
We'll have to wait and see whether the current rumours prove true.

1694,"It is reported from Saudi Arabia that it has introduced a new law - which prohibits women from having the ""tempting eyes"". But the news is from 2011, and it seems not even sue.

""A new law in Saudi Arabia, forcing women to wear full veils, if their eyes are considered too 'tempting'. It reports the British Metro and refers to a krönikeliknande opinion text from the Assyrian news agency Aina. ""

So writes the Omni in a short news text published on Wednesday evening, and join the ranks thus to a wide range of international media and web pages in recent days reported the same news. Including British Metro , US news website Inquisitr and Serbian Telegraph .

They all use the article from the news agency Aina source. The article is published on October 30, and is - as Omni mention - written in, and colored by, a personal tone . But not only that: it is also written by the legendary musician Cole Porter, who is mentioned in the article, but died in 1964. At least according to the article's byline .

Old news - from 2011

Does this sound fishy? It's weird. In fact, namely, the full text of the news agency Ainas article copied outright, from a post on the site the Daily Beast - published on 19 November 2011.

Even then, in 2011, circulated the news of the Saudi law widely, and published, among other things, the British Daily Mail . The original source of the time seems to have been an article on the site bikyamasr.com. There are today a weird Russian blog titled ""Business World"", but through service Internet Archive can the old article from November 16, 2011 read. The text sets out no earlier source.

So it is a three year old news now circulating as new. This results in multiple abnormalities. Under the text ""Prince Naif supports the new law"" links such as Omni to an article published this week on the site firsttoknow.com, alleging that ""Prince Naif, the Saudi throne appears to be an equally cruel ruler like his father King Abdullah, has spoken out in full support for the new law. ""

But that claim is not particularly new, but comes from the publications that were made in 2011 - Prince Naif, or Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud as his real name was, namely, died in 2012.

""Religious police deny""

Abdulhadi Khalaf is a lecturer in Sociology at Lund University and expert on the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East, and he says he has not heard about this news myself. Later he emailed a link.

- It is evident that the ""religious police"" has denied that it has issued such a law, writes Khalaf.

The religious police who Khalaf refers to the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of cargo (CPVPV), the Saudi authorities who declare that Sharia law is followed. Basically all the articles written about the law, as well in 2014 as in 2011, citing a Motlab Sheikh al Nabet to be a spokesperson for CPVPV.

But Sheikh Motlab al Nabet exists nowhere on the web, in addition to the items on this particular law. And the link that Abdulhadi Khalaf find goes to an article that is published on the Saudi news website Hail News that Abdulhadi Khalaf says is credible ""information relating to the Saudi authorities.""

There CPVPV denies the story of the illegal tempting eyes. The article writes Hail News that ""the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of cargo say they are not issuing any statement which is consistent with yesterday's international spread accusations that they'd begun to crack down on women with glamorous eyes.""

1710,"The three soldiers were reported missing from Joint Base Cape Cod on Saturday after last being seen at a nearby mall

The trio - Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar - have been found near Niagara Falls

They had traveled to the U.S. to take part in a long-established training exercise and were not considered to be a threat to the public

The three Afghanistan National Army officers who vanished during a training exercise in Massachusetts on Saturday have reportedly been found trying to cross the border into Canada.

Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar were stopped at the Rainbow Bridge, which spans New York and Ontario near Niagara Falls, on Monday, sources told NBC News.

The men, who were not armed, have been taken into custody.

It is not yet clear how they reached the area after they were last seen at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis, Massachusetts on Saturday.

Before they were found Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick said that they may have been seeking to defect to the United States.

The trio, who had been reported missing from Joint Base Cape Cod, were not considered a threat to the public, Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lieutenant Colonel James Sahady had said.

They had been due to take part in U.S. Central Command's Regional Cooperation exercise, which is held every year to foster better cooperation and military readiness between participating countries.

The men, who were cleared by the US State Department to participate, had been free to 'come and go' when they weren't taking part in exercises, and on Saturday, they had a free day.

'If they were off-duty, they could go to McDonald's or the mall,' he told Cape Cod Online.

Disappearing act: Three Afghanistan National Army soldiers had been reported missing from Camp Edwards (pictured) on Saturday after they failed to return following a trip to a nearby mall, officials said

Base authorities, state, and police were involved in the search for the missing soldiers, Sahady said.

Ed Davis, a security analyst, told CBS it was an 'unusual incident and it needs to be checked out'.

'The only cause for concern is the fact that there have been Afghan soldiers who have turned on their United States counterparts and I'm sure that's on most of the minds of the people doing the investigation,' he said.

The Regional Cooperation training exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.

Training exercise: The three men were involved in a long-standing training program with participating nations in Massachusetts. Pictured above are other Afghan soldiers following their graduation two weeks ago

Last seen: The soldiers were visiting the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis, on Saturday - but did not return

This year's exercise, which involves more than 200 participants from six nations including the U.S., wraps up on Wednesday. There are about a dozen Afghan soldiers still participating in the exercise.

The men, who are all housed at the base, were taking part in a joint exercise that focused on working on collaboration and tactical strategies with civilians, officers and senior enlisted personnel, Sahady said.

Military officials from Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia - as well as the U.S. - are also at the base as part of the training.

CBS News reported on Friday that two Afghan policemen were found after going missing from a separate training exercise held by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Quantico, Virginia."

1714,"When Jermell Hasson agreed to let Riverfront Times take his photo for a story about Ferguson protesters, he had no idea someone would later turn it into a viral and inflammatory meme.
Hasson carried a sign in front of the Ferguson police station that read: ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he leaves home. #blacklivesmatter #stayhuman""

Months later, a doctored photo of him holding a sign that says, ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store,"" has gone viral.

""That's slander to my character,"" Hasson tells Daily RFT. ""You can tell it's obviously been photoshopped. It was a horrible job.""

Imgur user Bdawgid says he's the Photoshop wizard behind the altered photo, which was posted to the photo-sharing site on November 27. Bdawgid writes on Imgur that he created the image because, ""it captured mine, and many others, frustration with this whole situation.""

More than 28,000 people shared the faked photo after Jim Gleason, a Maplewood native who's owned a south-county sign business for almost twenty years, posted it on Facebook with the (very incorrect) description: ""You can't make this up!!!!!""

More than 28,000 people shared this doctored photo.
Gleason wouldn't tell Daily RFT what motivated him to share the photo, which refers to the death of Michael Brown, who was recorded on surveillance cameras stealing from a convenience store and was later fatally shot by then-Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.
""I certainly didn't mean any harm by it,"" Gleason says. He says he found the doctored image on Facebook and took the image down after getting ""an onslaught of emails"" saying it was fake. ""We absolutely, unequivocally did not edit it.""

Riverfront Times reporter Mitch Ryals took the original photo of Hasson, 27, in September in front of the police station.

The original photo.
Hasson told Daily RFT in September he'd been sleeping in a parking lot across the street from the police station for weeks to peacefully protest Brown's death.
""We were literally on this lot for 24 hours for that whole month,"" Hasson told Daily RFT in September. ""I'm not saying here for an hour then going home. Twenty-four [hours] we were in this lot peacefully protesting. We've been rained on for a full week on this lot waiting for the sun to come out in the morning to dry us out.""

This week, Hasson tells Daily RFT he thinks the doctored photo is a sign that Ferguson protests are having an effect on the way people think.

""It shows that we are making a difference out here,"" Hasson says. ""For someone who has nothing better to do with their life than photoshop a sign, it shows me that we haven't been out here since August for no reason. They're trying to stop the movement, which they can't.""

Hasson says he has a message for Gleason and the thousands of people who shared the fake photo: ""Remove the hatred out of your heart, and come and see what we're doing for yourself.""

Gleason says he is surprised and saddened by the backlash to the photo he posted because ""qualified investigators at all levels of government"" concluded that Brown robbed the convenience store before his death.

""It appears that this young man robbed a store, assaulted a police officer, and it is just surprising to me the uprising when the physical evidence seems to be overwhelmingly in support of the police officer's actions,"" Gleason says.

People who objected to the provocative photo posted to the Facebook page for Gleason's business, Sign-A-Rama St. Louis, to warn customers.

""Makes the BEST racist memes on Facebook,"" one person sarcastically wrote on the shop's Facebook page. ""Gives good discounts to whites, charges darkies extra. Highly recommended to any whites in St. Louis looking for a good white pride meme.""

1717,"A 17-year-old transgender teenage girl in Ohio has died by what appears to have been suicide, leaving behind a Tumblr note that blames her parents for not accepting her gender identity, isolating her, and forcing her to attend faith-based therapy. ""There's no winning,"" the note reads, in part. ""There's no way out.""

Leelah Alcorn, born Joshua Ryan Alcorn, was walking along Interstate 71 when she was hit and killed by a semi-truck around 2:30 a.m. on the morning of Sunday, December 28. The local news accounts refer to Alcorn as male, but she blogged frequently on a Tumblr called ""Lazer Princess"" about living as a trans teen. Judging by the Tumblr, she was a fan of Sailor Moon, feminism, and stockings with cats on them; she regularly re-blogged inspirational photos of trans adults.

It's also where she published a post titled ""Suicide Note,"" which she had pre-scheduled before her death. From the beginning of the note:

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don't be sad, it's for the better. The life I would've lived isn't worth living in… because I'm transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy's body, and I've felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally ""boyish"" things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self. That's exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.
Alcorn apparently believed she'd never be able to transition successfully. She concludes:

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I've had enough. I'm never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I'm never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I'm never going to find a man who loves me. I'm never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There's no winning. There's no way out. I'm sad enough already, I don't need my life to get any worse. People say ""it gets better"" but that isn't true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

That's the gist of it, that's why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that's not a good enough reason for you, it's good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don't give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say ""that's fucked up"" and fix it. Fix society. Please.
On Facebook, Alcorn's mother has written, ""My sweet 16 year old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn went home to heaven this morning. He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck."" The message has been shared repeatedly by people who are upset that she is misgendering her child.

This is gut-wrenching, and it was avoidable. On Twitter, trans activists are mourning Leelah:

1727,"Apple Watch will take approximately two hours to fully charge and deliver all-day battery life with normal on-and-off usage, according to TechCrunch. Those estimates corroborate a previous report that also claimed the Apple Watch will deliver all-day battery life and support up to five hours of heavy usage per charge.

The report also claims that the Apple Watch will only deliver notifications while worn on the wrist. The smartwatch will not ping you for notifications without being in contact with skin so that the device is not disruptive at unnecessary times. Apple Watch will also stop delivering notifications when the battery reaches 10% or lower in an effort to conserve the remaining power.""Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. They require contact with your skin. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it’s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications.""Apple continues to tweak Digital Crown on the Apple Watch, giving the button a ""weightier, higher-end feel."" Pressing and holding down the Digital Crown activates Siri, which the report claims works well and can be used for labeling, directions and commands using a paired iPhone. The goal of the Apple Watch, the report describes, is to return some of your attention away from your smartphone by allowing you to communicate from your wrist on the go.

While both reports this afternoon have provided a closer look at the Apple Watch, there are still several question marks surrounding the wrist-worn device. That will change in less than three days, when Apple provides more details about the Apple Watch at its highly-anticipated ""Spring Forward"" media event in San Francisco. The keynote begins on Monday at 10 AM Pacific and MacRumors will be providing live coverage of the event.

1741,"A Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil figured out that there is really only one acceptable reason to get a third breast: to buck traditional beauty standards and purposely make yourself unattractive to men.

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,"" Tridevil said on a recent radio broadcast. ""Because I don’t want to date anymore.""

Given the fact that most men love boobs, I'm not entirely sure getting another one is the fastest route to unattractiveness, but her attempted commitment to misandry is commendable. Meanwhile, the photos look kinda 'shopped, so I'm really hoping this isn't some sort of viral marketing scheme for a Total Recall reboot."
1748,"The female Kurdish fighter who became a poster girl for the Kobane resistance before allegedly being beheaded by Islamic State militants is actually alive and well, it was claimed today.

The woman, known by the pseudonym Rehana, was celebrated as a symbol of hope for the besieged Syrian border city after an image of her making a peace sign was retweeted over 5,000 times.

That picture was followed days later by a gruesome photograph of an ISIS terrorist holding the severed head of a young woman, sparking rumours that Rehana had been savagely murdered.

But now friends of Rehana have told MailOnline that the dead woman in the photograph is in fact a different Kurdish resistance fighter, adding that Rehana managed to escape Kobane during intense fighting there last week and is now believed to be living in southern Turkey.

Safe: The Kurdish fighter Rehana - who became a poster girl for the Kobane resistance before allegedly being beheaded by Islamic State militants - is actually alive and well, her friends claimed today

A huge cloud of smoke is seen following an American airstrike in the Syrian town of Kobane this morning

Speaking of ISIS' sickening propaganda photograph, a journalist who was based in Kobane as recently as last week said the dead woman is not Rehana but another Kurdish resistance fighter.

'She is my friend and I confirm that she is alive. And the picture of beheaded female fighter is not Rehana's picture,' he told MailOnline, speaking on condition of anonymity.

He went on to say that he saw Rehana leave Kobane during intense fighting there last week, shortly before he was forced to do the same thing.

Although he lost temporarily lost contact with Rehana as they made their separate journeys over the nearby Turkish border, the journalist said he has been informed by friends that she is living as a refugee in Turkey, most likely in the southern Şanliurfa Province.

'She is in Turkey. I will try to gain her number because I lost the connection with her. She evacuated Kobane and I stayed in Kobane. At the beginning of the last clashes Rehana left Kobane,' he said.

MailOnline also spoke to another friend of Rehana's who confirmed the dead woman in the sickening ISIS photograph was not Rehana, who she described as 'the daughter of a martyr'.

'The facial features [of the head in the ISIS photo] are not hers,' she said, refusing to give her name.

However the friend claimed she was not with Rehana, had not seen her since the time the photograph emerged, and no longer had any way of contacting her.

'I can give news on her, but I don't want to talk until I get someone's advice... A person in Kobane has refuted this news [that she is dead], and I'm going to speak to him again tomorrow,' the friend said.

'Everyone's asking about her, using her. And I don't want to talk about her,' she went on to say.

The friends' claims that Rehana is still alive was reinforced by others who says they know Rehana and have spoken to her in recent days.

Among those claiming to have communicated with Rehana is the Syrian/Kurdish journalist Rashad Abdel Qader.

Qader said rumours that she had singlehandedly killed 100 ISIS fighters inside Kobane were untrue, but claimed she was still 'fighting fiercely'.

A female Kurdish fighter takes up a position during combat skills training before being deployed to fight ISIS

The suggestion Rehana may still be alive was first raised by the Swedish freelance journalist Carl Drott, who said he had met her during a ceremony in which the Kurdish YPJ, or Women's Defense Unit, was first set up in Kobane.

He said the dead woman in the ISIS photograph may initially look like Rehana, but on closer inspection her facial features and hair style and colour betrayed subtle differences.

He also said that as Rehana had left a law degree in Aleppo to fight join the fight in her hometown Kobane, she hadn't received the level of training required to become a full member of the YPJ and so worked as a reservist, providing support to those on the frontline.

Such claims might it highly unlikely she would have been able to singlehandedly kill 100 ISIS fighters, as per the rumours that spread when the photograph of her making the peace sign first emerged.

Syrian Kurds gather in the Turkish town of Suruc for the funeral of Kurdish fighters killed by ISIS in Kobane

The news that Rehana is almost certainly still alive came as Kurdish resistance fighters continue to push the Islamic State back in Kobane.

Among those fighters are thousands of women, an unusual phenomenon in the Muslim world in which warfare is often associated with manhood. In April, Kurdish fighters created all-female combat units that have grown to include more than 10,000 women.

These female fighters have played a major role in battles against IS, said Nasser Haj Mansour, a defense official in Syria's Kurdish region.

The Kurdish women now find themselves battling militants preaching an extreme form of Islam dictating that women only leave the house if absolutely necessary.

One Kurdish female fighter, who uses the nom de guerre of Afshin Kobani, used to be a teacher.

Now, the Kurdish Syrian woman has traded the classroom for the front lines in the battle for the town.

The 28-year-old Kurdish fighter said she decided to join the fight in her hometown when she saw Isis advances in Syria.

'I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,' said Kobani, who declined to reveal her birth name. 'This is our land - our own - and if we don't do it, who else will?'

The funeral for three Kurdish fighters who died fighting ISIS in Kobane was held in Suruc, Turkey last week

Young Kurdish in Suruc, Turkey men paint the tombstone of a YPG fighter killed over the border in Kobane

After more than a year of fighting, Kobani has risen through the ranks to become a commander of a mixed-gender unit. 'We are just the same as men; there's no difference,' she said. 'We can do any type of job, including armed mobilization.'

There is nothing new about Kurdish women fighters. They have fought alongside men for years in a guerrilla war against Turkey, seeking an independent Kurdistan which would encompass parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran.

The campaign for Kurdish independence has been pursued mainly by leftist militant groups that championed gender equality, such as the Kurdistan Workers Party in Turkey.

Suicide bombings have long been part of the Kurdish women fighters' battleground repertory.

Early this month, Deilar Kanj Khamis, better known by her military name Arin Mirkan, blew herself up outside Kobani, killing 10 IS fighters, according to Kurdish forces.

Haj Mansour, the Kurdish defense official, recounted that Kurdish fighters were forced to withdraw from a strategic hill south of the besieged town. Khamis stayed behind, attacking IS fighters with gunfire and grenades as they moved in.

Earlier this month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors events in Syria, reported ISIS militants beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women

Surrounded, she detonated explosives strapped to her body. The Kurds then recaptured the position - but lost it again on Wednesday.

Earlier this month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors events in Syria, reported Isis militants beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women, captured in clashes near Turkish border.

The news that Rehana is almost certainly still alive comes as militants from the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front attacked the government-held Syrian city of Idlib, killing dozens of soldiers loyal to the regime and temporarily taking control of a number of buildings.

The militants were later pushed back into the outskirts of the city, which has been held by the government after being briefly seized by rebel forces in 2012.

British ISIS hostage John Cantlie has been used as a news reporter from the battle-ravaged city of Kobane in a slickly-produced new video released by the insurgents.

The photojournalist, who was captured last year while working in Syria, is seen addressing the camera in the propaganda video as he walks around what he claims is the city.

In the news broadcast-style footage, entitled Inside 'Ayn-Islam, Mr Cantlie appears to be reading from a prepared script as he says that despite reports coming from the west, the city is still in the hands of the insurgents, who he refers to as the mujahideen.

The clip opens with an aerial shot, purportedly of the city, which is said to have been filmed using a drone, before Mr Cantlie begins his report.

The 'drone of the Islamic State Army' shows a deserted city accompanied by the sound of sporadic gun fire.

Dressed in a loose-fitting black shirt, his hair slightly longer than in other videos released by the extremist group, Mr Cantlie appears to be in good health as he addresses the camera in the five-and-a-half minute broadcast.

His beard also appears longer, with a few jihadists on social media suggesting that Cantlie might be on the verge of converting to Islam.

He starts the report by saying: 'Hello, I'm John Cantlie and today we are in the city of Kobane on the Syrian-Turkish border.'

Breaking off to point out Turkey 'right behind' him, he says he is speaking from the zone said to be controlled by the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which is battling IS fighters.

The doctor who reportedly took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was under anesthesia has denied she ever took the photo, according to reports.

The woman, who has been identified as Dr. Gwen Korovin according to TMZ , refused to comment when photographers spotted her heading to work in New York a matter of hours ago - but friends now insist it's ""lies"".

According to TMZ, Dr Korovin also told friends she never performed a biopsy, as has been claimed, and added CNN's source - who originally broke the story about the selfie - is ""making up lies"".

But sources were unable to say if the doctor performed any other procedure.

It comes shortly after she was spotted rushing past photographers today, refusing to comment when asked about the claims (see video below).

Dr Korovin wouldn't look at the camera when she was asked to comment in New York, and walked straight inside despite photographers shouting questions about the procedure and alleged selfie.

Arriving at work with a companion to protect her from cameras, the doctor hid behind huge sunglasses as she was ushered inside.

It’s thought Dr Gwen, who is an ear, nose and throat doctor to the stars, was working as Joan’s personal doctor when she attended the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 to undergo a routine procedure.

Mirror Celeb have contacted for comment.

On Wednesday it was claimed that the doctor, now believed to be Gwen, took a selfie with the star while she was under anaesthesia.

The incident allegedly occurred in Manhattan's Yorkville ­Endoscopy shortly before Joan, 81, underwent a procedure on her vocal chords that could have led to her suffering a cardiac arrest, CNN reports.

The clinic have made it very clear that they did not perform the alleged biopsy or put the comedienne under anaesthesia.

Following Joan’s death Dr. Lawrence - who is a world renowned gastroenterologist and co-owner of the clinic – resigned from his position.

And it seems it’s not her first time in the limelight – she previously appeared in a Celine Dion documentary.

The doctor, whose offices are on East 77th Street, New York, has previously worked with Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and Hugh Jackman.

Her office walls are believed to be lined with pictures of the famous people she has looked after over the years.

1759,"A new law in Saudi Arabia banning ‘tempting eyes’ has become the latest example of female oppression in the country.

The law, which states that women with alluring eyes will be forced to wear a full veil, has been branded ‘stupid’ by dissenters and roundly criticised on social media, aina.org reports.

Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of the Saudi Arabian Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, said they ‘had the right’ to force women to cover their face.

‘The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones,’ he said.

‘We have the right to do so.’

Many commentators wondered how the word ‘tempting’ would be applied.

One unnamed journalist in the country suggested it referred to ‘uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup.’

‘Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble,’ they added.

Prince Naif, whose impending ascension to the Saudi throne many hoped would spell an end to this kind of draconian oppression, looks likely to be as intolerant as his father King Abdullah after suggesting that any Muslim should support the Committee’s new law.

‘The committee is supported by all sides,’ he said.

1765,"A five-year-old has been handed an invoice and his parents threatened with court action - for missing his friend's birthday party.

Derek Nash and his partner Tanya Walsh discovered the £15.95 ""no show fee"" invoice after it was slipped into their son Alex's school bag.

Mr Nash said he originally ""thought it was a joke"", but the issue has remained unresolved with the birthday boy's mother, Julie Lawrence, threatening small claims court.

His partner confronted Ms Lawrence in a series of posts on Facebook in a bid to resolve the situation.

The family confirmed their son would be attending the party at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre just before the Christmas holidays.

However, Mr Nash, from Torpoint, Cornwall, realised he had already arranged for their daughter to go on a day trip with her grandparents.

He said: ""She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.

""By this time we did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy's mother] know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do - he chose to be with his grandparents.""

Alex returned to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School on January 6, but the family were shocked to receive the bill just over a week later.

Mr Nash added: ""My partner looked out for [the friend's mother] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn't see her.

""But on January 15 she looked in Alex's school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for £15.95 for a child's party no show fee.

""I asked Alex's class teacher if [the child's mother] had given anything to her. She said, 'Yes, a brown envelope'.

""I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up, but I just can't believe the way she has gone around it.""

Ms Lawrence has since threatened the family that she would take the case to a small claims court, while the birthday boy will no longer play with Alex at school.

Mr Nash added: ""I drive all around the south west for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this. They're all quite incredulous that this has happened. I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words.""

Ms Lawrence said the boy's non-attendance left her out of pocket and insisted his parents did have details to tell her he was not going.

1767,"Eight to go! Bart's owners accepted their loss after he was hit by car and buried him in his Tampa backyard, but it appears the tough feline survived despite severe head trauma, a broken jaw and a dead eye.

A Florida cat written off for dead after being hit by a car stunned its owner by digging its way out of his grave so he could be fed, it's claimed.

Ellis Huston thought he'd said his final goodbyes to beloved kittie Bart when he buried him in his Tampa backyard shortly after he was knocked down by a vehicle, according to FOX 13.

But he was left flabbergasted when, several days later, the injured but very alive mog wound up outside his home.

The gutsy pet had severe trauma to his head, a broken jaw and a dead eye. But he still begged for food.

Bart was rushed to the vets, where medics said he would likely lose an eye but would hopefully survive.

Huston said he was startled by the feline's apparent return from the dead.

Rescuers at the Tampa Bay Humane Society, where he is currently being treated, believed he may have regained consciousness shortly after being buried, reports FOX 13.

They think he clawed his way out of the ground before hiding for several days before mustering up the courage to go home.

1770,"Apparently Las Vegas isn't the only city on the National Hockey League's expansion team radar: Seattle, Toronto and Quebec City will add franchises as well with a target date of 2017, according to a tweet from SportsBusinessNews' Howard Bloom.

Bloom said the four-fold expansion, which would increase the number of NHL teams to 34 and the number of Canadian team to nine, could raise $1.4 billion in expansion fees.

A report Tuesday in Canada's The Province revealed the finalization of an NHL franchise in Las Vegas, with only the new team's ownership left to determine. The move would entitle Las Vegas to a professional sports franchise in one of the four major sports league's for the first time in the city's history. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has previously voiced disapproval of such a move out of concern over the city's potentially damaging connection to the sports betting industry.
On Wednesday morning, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly publicly denied that anything was imminent in Las Vegas.

Seattle has been at the center of expansion rumors for more than a year and Quebec City has a new arena that is slated to open in 2015. A new team in Toronto would mean a second franchise for the city. The Maple Leafs are the NHL's highest grossing and most valuable franchise by net worth.

1773,"Argentinean President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner officially became the godmother of a Jewish boy last Tuesday.

But the reasons behind the ceremonial act have gotten blurred with folklore about werewolves in South America.

It was reported that the adoption was connected to an ancient legend or myth where the seventh son born after six boys becomes a werewolf. Turns out, there's a custom involving Argentina's President taking god children, and a myth about werewolves, and other than involving seventh sons, they are unrelated, according to a report in the Guardian Monday.

According to Argentinian custom, the country's president takes the seventh child of Argentine families as a godchild. The honor only applied to Catholic children before 2009. According to reports, Kirchner took Yair Tawil as a godson after his parents were initially denied in their request in 1993. He appealed and last week became the first Jewish god son of the country's president.

Earlier reports, including one in UPI, explained that according to Argentinian legend, the seventh son in a daughter-less family will turn into a werewolf (""el lobison"") on his 13th birthday.

""The legend became so feared that families would abandon or kill their sons,"" the UPI story stated. ""To counteract this stigma, the president of Argentina began in 1907 to adopt one of the boys as their godson.""

But Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told the Guardian that the two traditions aren't actually linked.

""The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,"" he explained.

According to Balmaceda, the later custom was actually started in the early 1900s by German and Russian emigres who brought the tradition to Argentina from Europe. The custom became official law in 1974, unrelated to werewolves.

Here's one of de Kirchner's tweets from last week's ceremony:"
1779,"Apple could be planning to introduce the much-rumored 12-inch Retina MacBook Air during its March 9 Apple Watch event, according to one site that claims to have sources within Apple. The Michael Report believes Apple will use the event to debut the ultrathin MacBook, which is rumored to have a Retina display and a redesigned chassis.Many are expecting Apple talk more about the Apple Watch. However, sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.While there have been no concrete rumors from major sites linking the Retina MacBook Air to Apple's March 9 event, previous rumors have indicated that Apple is planning for a spring release. Apple supplier Quanta is said to have begun mass production of the notebook in January, and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted a March launch for the MacBook.

Rendering of the 12-inch Retina MacBook Air created by Martin Hajek
When taking these rumors into account, along with the fact that the MacBook Air is due for an update, the introduction of the Retina MacBook Air at Apple's March 9 event does seem like a possibility. It's also possible Apple will introduce new models of the existing 11 and 13-inch MacBook Air at the event -- the last update was in April and there was a rumor suggesting an update in February was imminent. Core M Broadwell chips believed to be appropriate for the 12-inch Retina MacBook have been available since November, and chips appropriate for the standard MacBook Air began shipping in January.

Along with a Retina display, the 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to come without a fan assembly for silent operation, made possible by the aforementioned Core M chips, and it may also include a revamped trackpad that does not incorporate a mechanical button. It is said to feature smaller bezels in a Retina MacBook Pro-style black, a keyboard that stretches right to the edges of the machine, and speakers that are located above the keyboard.

The Michael Report has a mixed track record when it comes to rumors. The site accurately predicted some design elements of the iPad Air 2, but its predictions may have been based on dummy models that were circulating around the Internet at the time. The site also shared details on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus ahead of their launch, inaccurately calling the iPhone 6 Plus the ""iPhone 6L"" and suggesting the iPhones would come with quad-core processors and sapphire displays.

More details about what Apple plans to unveil at its Monday, March 9 event may come out through the week. Thus far, many sites have agreed that the focal point of the event will be the Apple Watch, with Apple unveiling new details about the device like its price and its official launch date.

1793,"Hewlett-Packard is officially splitting in two. Following rumors over the weekend, HP is announcing today that it will separate its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. The split means current CEO Meg Whitman will become the chairman of the PC and printer operation, and continue as CEO of the split-off enterprise business. Dion Weisler, an executive at HP’s PC business, will take over as CEO of the company’s PC and printer operation.

HP Enterprise is the newly split-off part of the original company, and HP Inc will continue to focus on PCs and printers. ""The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan,"" says HP CEO Meg Whitman. ""It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders."" HP is planning to complete the split by the end of fiscal 2015, and the structure will mean the company's total planned layoffs will rise to 55,000 from an earlier estimate of 45,000 to 50,000 cuts.

Today’s split is a significant change for the company, following rumors from 2011 that HP was considering a similar split at the time. Those reports surfaced shortly before HP appointed Meg Witman as CEO, just 11 months after former CEO Leo Apotheker took over from Mark Hurd after he was forced to resign amidst charges of inappropriate business conduct. Apotheker spearheaded a disastrous acquisition of Autonomy, and failed to capitalize on the company’s purchase of webOS.

Whitman’s era at HP has seen the company struggle to cement a solid position in the industry, leaving Lenovo to dominate PC sales worldwide. Whitman’s initial assessment of the company after around six months left her feeling it was ""too complex and too slow,"" noting it had underinvested in its PC division. Instead of significant investment, Whitman claimed in 2012 that the company had to offer a smartphone, before failing to announce one in 2013. Board members reportedly mulled spinning off the company’s consumer PC business in 2013, but it never happened. HP has recently focused on Android tablets, and even an Android laptop, after describing Microsoft as an ""outright competitor.""

HP and Microsoft appear to be forming a closer relationship with the launch of new low-cost Stream PCs. Although Lenovo continues to push Windows-based PCs, Microsoft still needs close PC allies as it demonstrated with a $2 billion loan to help Dell go private last year. That particular deal may have angered HP, but the renewed partnership will see Microsoft and HP take on Chromebooks this holiday season. HP is also planning to sell a smartwatch this fall.

A new HP says it will focus on ""new computing experiences"" and technologies like 3D printing. ""As the market leader in printing and personal systems, an independent HP Inc. will be extremely well positioned to deliver that innovation across our traditional markets as well as extend our leadership into new markets like 3-D printing and new computing experiences -- inventing technology that empowers people to create, interact and inspire like never before,"" says Dion Weisler, head of HP's Printing and Personal Systems business."

1812,"TEHRAN (FNA)- Iraq's army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.
""The Iraqi Parliament's National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,"" Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

""We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL's control in Al-Baqdadi region,"" the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.

Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition's planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.

""There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition's military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),"" he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

""The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, ""These documents are given to the investigation committee ... and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.""

Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.

""The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,"" Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.

He said the coalition's support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, ""The coalition has not targeted ISIL's main positions in Iraq.""

In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are ""not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month"".

Gharawi added that ""the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.""

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that ""unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city"".

Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.

""The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,"" Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.

""The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,"" she added.

Hababi said that the coalition's precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.

In late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.

Field sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.

In October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.

“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group - while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition's and the US' claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.

The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.

The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.

Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.

The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL's deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue."
1868,"A pregnant St. Louis woman was blinded in her left eye after a police officer on Tuesday fired a non-lethal bean bag round at her car on the outskirts of Ferguson, according to reports. The woman claimed on Facebook that she had to have her eye removed.

Dornnella Conner was sitting in the passenger seat of the vehicle at a BP gas station on New Halls Ferry Road in St. Louis when the incident occurred, New York Daily News reported. Police had been called to the area after reports of trouble during a night of unrest in Ferguson and across the U.S..

Conner's boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, was reportedly driving the car out of the gas station when police opened fire.

Conner says he was trying to drive around the officers. However, police say he was driving toward them, and that the officer fired because he feared for his own safety, according to local media. The bean bag round hit and shattered the front passenger window.

""I didn’t have any weapons, I wasn’t looting or anything. I was just out with my boyfriend. We was just riding around respecting Mike Brown,"" she told local media outlet KMOV.

""I'm very upset and very disappointed with the tactics that they used,"" Conner's father Donnell added. ""I understand that it was chaos, but there was no reason to fire upon an innocent person sitting in a vehicle. How can a pregnant person, in a car in a seatbelt, be causing chaos?”

Conner subsequently vowed to seek justice for the incident on her Facebook page (where she also goes by the name ""Lenora Prince""). ""I will have justice for what they've done to me,"" she wrote, ""But I'm happy I'm alive.""

Sixteen people were arrested at the gas station, and police say they still don't know who was firing gunshots there. They've issued a warrant for the arrest of Lee, Conner's boyfriend.

1870,"Inside sources say Apple is shutting down the Beats Music streaming service. The news comes mere months after Apple’s plans to buy Beats were revealed. Here’s what you need to know.

1. Multiple Sources Are Confirming the End of Beats
beats-music-iphone-app

TechCrunch reports that multiple sources have confirmed Apple’s plans to shut down Beats Music, including “several prominent employees at Apple and Beats.” As many as five people close to the deal have confirmed the rumor about the end of Beats Music.


2. Beats Music Might End, But Beats Headphones Will Continue

Apple Insider writes “The rumor [about Beats Music shutting down] would suggest that Apple’s $3 billion buyout of Beats was really about the headphones side of the business, as well as the talent and credibility brought on by the ‘acqui-hires’ of Beats’s Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.”

Entrepreneur magazine notes that Apple paid $3.2 billion to acquire Beats earlier this year. The same article notes that Beats has had a rapid rise to the top: In 2012, just four years after Beats began selling headphones, the company had 40 percent market share. The headphone part of the Beats brand is still very much alive and kicking.


3. Beats Music May Get Rolled Into iTunes

Business Insider predicts that the Beats Music streaming service will be absorbed into the larger iTunes ecosystem:

“It’s more likely that Apple will take the Beats Music technology and incorporate it into iTunes and/or iTunes Radio. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told Charlie Rose that he was so impressed with Beats Music that he “couldn’t sleep” after listening to it for the first time. That doesn’t sound like a product Cook would want to completely kill off.

Beats Music also has a neat feature that Apple might want to incorporate into future products. “The sentence” gives users the opportunity to select music based on their activity or location (think “I’m on a boat” or “I’m on a rooftop and feel like going back in time”).”


4. Apple Is Planning A Mysterious New Music Project

The Verge notes that there are rumors that Apple is planning a “significant music announcement” for next year. The shutdown of Beats Music may be the first step towards making that big announcement, whatever it may be.

Apple’s other big announcement in the first half of 2015 will be the official release date of the Apple Watch. Perhaps the Apple Watch will be involved in Apple’s next music project in some way, though it is too early to say so with any degree of certainty.



5. The Beats Music App Was Only Added to Apple TV a Few Days Ago

Apple Insider notes that a Beats Music app was just added to the Apple TV interface on September 17, making the plans for a Beats Music shutdown seem even more surprising. It does seem odd that Apple would add Beats to the Apple TV one week, and then start shutting down the service a week later. It’s fair to assume that if the rumors are true, and Apple is killing Beats Music, it won’t shut down the service overnight. Expect Apple to give the service a final termination date that’s some distance in the future."
1872,"From a reader in Hong Kong:

I was at the uneventful (if tense) Legco [Legislative Council] demonstration on Saturday as well as last night's demonstrations between Causeway Bay and Central.

It was as much depressing as, ultimately, uplifting. When I was incapacitated by a blast of pepper spray, I somehow found myself being reverse crowd-surfed to a safe area.

There, a young girl cradled my head and poured water into my eyes. Some others wiped the chemicals off my arms and legs. When they went on to help the next injured person, an old woman kept watch over me, speaking soft Cantonese and plying me with all manner of snacks and drinks. These were complete strangers. Later, when we scrambled to avoid the first tear gas attack, a small band of people committed to staying put and helping the crush of smoke victims climb over the concrete barriers and into safety.
When we felt threatened, we opened umbrellas and raised our hands.

When the police decided to retake the street, they sprayed chemicals in our faces, pointed rifles at us, smashed our limbs with batons. While they were throwing tear gas with reckless abandon, our side threw not one rock, not one bottle, not one egg, nothing. None from our side brandished a firearm, a knife, a club, anything at all. I have neither seen nor heard any reports of protesters looting, burning cars, destroying property, or intentionally injuring police.

Young women felt safe enough to doze off during the lulls. In what other city would tens of thousands of 'rioters' act with such restraint?

The government warned against the chaos Occupy Central would cause. It's all too clear to me which side is supplying the chaos and which side is conducting itself with dignity. These demonstrations may have been sparked by anger, but they're sustained by compassion and love.
I have been working around the clock on a non-China-related magazine project (as the time of this post indicates) and will wait until tomorrow to say something more about the consequential events underway in Hong Kong.

It is of course interesting to note the spread of the ""hands-up/ don't shoot!"" gesture from Ferguson to Hong Kong, but the circumstances in the two places have 100 times more differences than similarities. There are profound differences as well with the other obvious comparison for mass movements among Chinese people, namely the movements throughout China in the summer of 1989.

What is happening in Hong Kong is uplifting, for reasons this reader explains—and surprising, for anyone who knows the generally non-politicized nature of Hong Kong.

But it is also quite a sobering time, as soon as you think about the options open to the PRC government in Beijing, and the instincts it has displayed in the face of all recent challenges of this sort. Beyond question, this is a challenge that the still-relatively new government of ""Mr. 11,"" Xi Jinping, has brought upon himself. That doesn't mean that it will end nicely.

More tomorrow, and overnight good wishes to those driven to such unexpected expressions in Hong Kong."
1879,"Rumors swirled over the weekend that demonstrators in Hong Kong were using the “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture in solidarity with protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.

On Sunday, Vox published a story headlined, “Hong Kong’s protesters are using the same ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ gesture used in Ferguson.”

While the article did note that “it’s impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson,” it concluded contending that “it’s fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world, however it got there.”

Other similar stories followed soon after. MSNBC published an article Monday titled, “In Hong Kong, protesters say ‘hands up, don’t shoot!’” The Daily Mail published a story saying that protesters in Hong Kong had copied the gesture used by U.S. demonstrators.

But, a story in Quartz Sunday appeared to challenge the idea that the gesture used by Hong Kong demonstrators was linked to Ferguson.

According to the story, the gesture used by those in Hong Kong was not a deliberate show of solidarity:

Most Hong Kong protesters aren’t purposefully mimicking “hands up, don’t shoot,”as some have suggested. Instead, the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police.

Asked about any link between the gesture and Ferguson, Icy Ng, a 22-year-old design student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University said, “I don’t think so. We have our hands up for showing both the police and media that we have no weapons in our hands.” Ng had not heard of the Ferguson protests. Another demonstrator, with the pro-democracy group Occupy Central, Ellie Ng said the gesture had nothing to do with Ferguson and is intended to demonstrate that “Hong Kong protesters are peaceful, unarmed, and mild.” (A more important symbol for the movement may be the umbrella, which protesters have been using to protect themselves against pepper spray and tear gas.)

The Washington Post followed up Monday with a similar analysis:

Sunday, Max Fisher wrote a story for Vox.com arguing that the ‘hands up don’t shoot’ gesture had spread from protests in Ferguson to the pro-democracy demonstrations on the streets of Hong Kong. However, another writer at Quartz.com, who has actually interviewed protesters, says that this is wrong. The evidence seems to show that the gesture had probably not in fact ‘spread’ as Fisher and other commentators believed. Instead, the activists organizing the protests appear to have independently chosen to hold their hands up to emphasize their peaceful intentions to police.

Vox later corrected their post, addressing the controversy.

“Still, Hong Kongers pride themselves on being plugged in to the world, so it is within the realm of possibility that some of them followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use, even if only subconsciously,” their story now argues.

1886,"American hostage Steven Sotloff has reportedly been executed by jihadist terrorists. There was no immediate confirmation of the video.

Sotloff, 31, disappeared while reporting in Syria in August 2013. His apparent kidnap was not widely reported until he appeared on a video released last month by the Isil.

In the footage a masked militant beheads US reporter James Foley then parades Mr Sotloff, warning he will meet the same fate unless US President Barack Obama ends air strikes against the group in Iraq.

1892,"According to a thread on Reddit — so take this with a pinch of salt — Apple CEO Tim Cook personally requested that the ""on hold"" music for people calling customer service be changed and improved after he received an email from an Apple user who was disappointed that the quality of the music was so poor. ""Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done,"" the Reddit user says.

It almost doesn't matter whether this story is true or not. People will believe it because it dovetails seamlessly with Apple's obsession with detail and quality. And the circumstantial evidence leading up the story (told in full, below) is that Cook does indeed personally read the email he gets each day from customers. ""I get hundreds, and some days thousands of emails from customers. This is a privilege because they talk to you as if you're sitting at their kitchen table,"" he once told NBC, according to Apple Insider.

The rap against Cook is that while he might be a good CEO, he may not be the great, visionary CEO that Apple needs. Recently, however, with Apple gearing up to release two large-format iPhone 6 models, an iWatch wearable device and — possibly — some sort of push into healthcare or an extension of Apple TV's capabilities, Cook is looking more and more like The Man.

Part of the case in favor of Cook is not that he is a ranting visionary who can rouse the masses like founder Steve Jobs. Rather, it's that he's a super-manager who can make all the different arms of Apple's now-vast empire work together like Swiss (smart)watch.

So the idea that he would reach down into the company's bowels to tweak the way the on-hold muzak sounds when people call up for help sounds exactly like something this super-manager would do.

Here's what Reddit user ""lerde"" wrote:

I once sent Tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with Apple. It was super low quality, therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because I was on hold for 20+ minutes for something so simple (iPhone didn't turn on, needed to set up a repair as in my country no Apple Store = have to send it to another country).

Much to my surprise a lady from Cupertino called me up the next day, saying she'd received a concerning email from Tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone, that Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done. She assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections.

1903,"Jasmine Tridevil, a massage therapist in Tampa, Florida, claims that she had a third breast implanted to get famous, land a reality show, and become ""unattractive to men"" because she doesn't ""want to date anymore."" From CBS Tampa Bay:

...“It was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.

Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.

Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said. “My dad is still there for me.”

Here is Jasmine Tridevil's Twitter.

Here's a Real Radio 104.1 interview:"
1907,"In order to become a reality star, a woman from Florida underwent an expensive surgery to implant a third breast on her chest.

Massage therapist Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) decided to take the extreme step as she wants her own reality show on MTV, the 9 News reported.

Tridevil reportedly spent $20,000 to have a third breast. The procedure was done a few months ago and the extra breast was constructed with silicone implants and skin tissues taken from her abdomen, the website reported.

However, Tridevil's doctors could not create an artificial areola, which she managed on her own by tattooing it.

Nevertheless, the reality show aspirant had a difficult time finding a doctor who would do the procedure by ignoring medical ethics.

""I called 50 doctors. It was really hard finding someone who would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she told real radio 104.1, via 9News.

When asked about her family's reaction to the creepy news of her third breast implant, she said: ""My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.""

Tridevil went on to claim she wanted this to happen to make herself look unattractive as she is not interested in dating anymore.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

""Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore make-up and cute clothes, I can still, you know, feel pretty.""

Reality shows on popular networks have always fascinated youngsters who want to grab their 15 minutes of fame and become popular.

""Reality and fantasy are blurred. The consequences of bad behaviour and poor choices are never questioned. On the contrary, bad behaviour is welcomed because sensationalism attracts more viewers. The danger lies in that they lose sight of their own sense of self-worth and critical thinking,"" a report from NDLA reads.

1910,"One tactic that should prevent overly hormonal street-bros from catcalling women is imagining what their own mothers would think of this behavior. In a new Peruvian ad, however, that threat becomes an all-too-real Freudian nightmare.


Athletics brand Everlast recently teamed up with activist group Paremos el Acoso Callejero (Stop Street Harassment) to teach catcallers on the streets of Lima what their mothers apparently never taught them--by using the people in the world most suited for that very task. In the viral video, which is clearly staged, although it's fun to pretend that it isn't, the Paremos team gets hold of the mothers of area serial harassers and recruits them for a guerrilla mission to end their sons' lives.


These women disguise themselves with dresses, wigs and a copious amount of makeup to go undercover as catcall-bait--and it works to a degree that will alternately delight and horrify. It's probably the funniest possible way to call attention to the fact that 7 out of 10 women on the streets of Peru are sexually assaulted. This dumb video may not be real, but the problem is, and it's a good way to remind potential catcallers of the inherent grossness of their actions."
1914,"The son of a North Korean aide linked to Kim Jong-un's executed uncle is believed to be on the run in France after evading abduction by agents of the communist regime.

According to diplomatic sources, the man - identified only by his surname Han - has escaped detection amid fears he may be forcibly taken back to the secretive nation to be executed.

The architecture student has ties to Kim Jong-un's uncle, Jang Song-thaek, the regime's former second in command who was executed for treason in December 2013.

The student disappeared after his father was executed by the regime led by Kim-Jong-Un (pictured)

He disappeared last month while studying at Paris' prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette and speculation was rife as to whether the student had been captured or was hiding out in France.

But now a diplomatic source has revealed that despite attempts to force Han to return to North Korea, the student has evaded capture as is 'somewhere in France', The Telegraph reported.

Park Sung-jin, Paris correspondent for Yonhap, South Korea's biggest news agency which broke the story, told the newspaper: 'Since the 1980s, when the regime changes and someone is executed and his relatives and friends and family are studying abroad, they are brought home.

'If Han returned he would likely be kept in a political prison or executed. That has happened many times. He knew what was awaiting him, so he escaped.'

Han disappeared last month while studying at the prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette (pictured)

There are fears that the student may be forcibly taken back to the North Korea to be executed (pictured, Kim Jong-Un during a ceremony for officials and personnel in the fishery field of the Korean People's Army)

Han is the son of one of Jang Song-thaek's closest aides. His father is known to have been 'purged' recently as Kim attempts to reassert his authority after disappearing himself this summer.

The student had been enrolled at the French school since 2011 along with nine other students who were invited to join by the French government.

The disappearance comes amid high tensions between the U.S. and North Korea in the wake of the Sony Entertainment hacking scandal and the release of The Interview, a film about the assassination of Kim Jong-un.

As with most western nations, North Korea has no official ties with Paris, but maintains a small delegation to deal with limited economic negotiations.

However, what few relations the two nations do have risk being damaged further if it transpires Han is being sheltered by French authorities.

Jang, Kim Jong-un's mentor, second in command, and uncle, was executed for treason last December after being accused of planning a coup.

Jang Song-thaek, Kim's uncle and mentor was purged last December after being accused of a coup. Han is reported to have links to Jang, as his father was one of Jang's advisors

According to reports the student may have escaped his captors, but it is not known if he was recaptured or if he is hiding somewhere in France (Kim Jong-un pictured on a visit to a fish factory in North Korea)

In a statement at the time, Pyongyang called Jang Song Thaek a 'traitor to the nation for all ages,' 'worse than a dog' and 'despicable human scum'.

Since then, potentially hundreds of supporters and relatives have been rounded up and either executed or sent to labour camps as Kim has sought to wipe the Jang family out.

There were thoughts that Kim could have been deposed himself this summer after he was pictured limping at a state event, before going missing for several weeks.

However he was soon back in the spotlight and officials said he had gone missing in order to have a cyst removed from his ankle."

1930,"An Egyptian man has reportedly delivered a financial blow to the Islamic State (Isis) by becoming ""emir"" of its alms department and then fleeing with almost one million US dollars to Turkey.

Abu Obeida (or Ubaidah) al-Masri, secretary of the Zakat (charity) bureau and treasurer of IS Syrian branch, eloped with the funds amounting to ""billion Syrian pounds"" which have been collected by his department in Deir Ez Zour province, Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper reported, citing Syrian Press Center news site.

According to some rumours, IS militants have issued an order to stop recruiting Egyptian jihadists because of the incident.

The claim could not be independently verified by IBTimes UK.

IS imposed a Zakat tax on merchants and industrialists in the areas under its control in the north-eastern countryside of Aleppo.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Isis ""has forced the merchants and industrialists to pay 2.5% of each sale.""

The merchants told the militants that they are already paying money to the poor families, but IS responded that those families should report to the Zakat bureau instead.

""The money paid to the poor without reference to the Zakat Chamber is an act of charity, but it doesn't exempt traders from paying to the Zakat Chamber,"" IS reportedly said.

The Zakat is the third Pillar of Islam and refers to the systematic giving of 2.5% of one's wealth each year to benefit the poor. The rate only applies to cash, gold and silver and commercial items."

The 17-year-old scheduled the post to go live on her blog in advance before committing suicide on the I-71 highway in Ohio, USA.

The suicide note detailed her early problems with transgender dysphoria and the struggles of growing up in an oppressive household.

She accused her devout Christian parents of blocking her transition and refusing to acknowledge her true gender.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

In a second post, also scheduled, Alcorn wrote: ""Mom and Dad: Fuck you. You can’t just control other people like that. That’s messed up.""

Her mother Carla Alcorn posted a tribute to her daughter on Facebook, but referred to her as ""son"" and used her birth name, making no mention of suicide.

At the end of her note, Leelah pleaded: ""My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say 'that’s fucked up' and fix it. Fix society. Please.""

Women in Saudi Arabia already have to cover their hair, and, in some regions, their faces while in public. If they do not, they face punishments including fines and public floggings.

The CPVPV has repeatedly been accused of human rights violations. Founded in 1940, its function is to ensure Islamic laws are not broken in public in Saudi Arabia.

The video comes weeks after ISIS released a video in which it beheaded another American journalist, James Foley. In that video, the militants threatened to murder Sotloff next if the US bombing of ISIS targets continued.

The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, was in the middle of his daily briefing with journalists when the news broke. He said that the Obama administration would work to confirm the authenticity of the video, adding, ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Sotloff's family.""

Sotloff, 31, was kidnapped in 2013 while reporting on the bloody civil war in Syria. He had been a freelancer for outlets such as Time magazine and Foreign Policy.

Recently, the New York Times ran a profile of Sotloff. Friends of his told the paper that he was a ""selfless,"" ""loyal"" and ""caring"" person.

Not that this new gold is anything you'd need a new magical alchemy to concoct - this is just a matter of preparation and process.

The Apple Watch comes in several different editions. One of them is called Apple Watch Edition. ""The Edition collection,"" says Apple, ""features six uniquely elegant expressions of Apple Watch.""

The cheapest Sport is set to cost around £250, but the Edition — which features 18-carat gold — is expected to sell for thousands of pounds.

Because of the high price, the Edition is likely to have its own sales process, according to the report. That is likely to be more similar to that in jewellery stores.

Joan Rivers' personal doctor reportedly took a selfie with the US comedian while she was under general anaesthetic.

The claim was made by a staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic where Rivers underwent a scheduled endoscopy late last month, according to CNN.

The 81-year-old went into cardiac arrest on the operating table and died a week later at Mount Sinai Hospital.

The endoscopy procedure was conducted by gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, but CNN cited their source as saying a second doctor entered the room afterwards and performed an unplanned and unauthorised biopsy on Rivers' vocal chords.

That doctor, described only as the comic's personal ear, nose and throat physician, was reportedly not certified by the clinic as required by law.

According to the CNN report, the same source told a state health department investigation into Rivers' death that the doctor first took a selfie with the unconscious star.

They also said the investigators believe Rivers could have suffered the cardiac arrest after the biopsy caused her throat to swell and cut off the flow of oxygen to her lungs.

The clinic declined to respond to the comments about a selfie, but last week issued a statement saying ""a biopsy of the vocal cords"" has ever been performed on site.

Patient confidentiality laws prohibited them from specifically referencing Rivers' case.

A couple of days later a spokesperson for the clinic said Dr Cohen was no longer the facility's medical director and was not performing procedures there.

2026,"After the news that a Floridian woman had an operation to add a third boob to her chest, we decided to look at the world's weirdest breasts

Jasmine Tridevil, a Floridian massage therapist, has had an operation to give herself a third breast, in what is perhaps the most controversial boob job of 2014.

We decided to look at the three most statistically unlikely pairs of breasts in the world.

1. Jasmine Tridevil- Three breasts

Jasmine had to call 50-60 doctors in order to get her controversial operation. She said: “It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics”.

She did it because she wanted a reality TV show on MTV, but she had another reason, too.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

Average: Most women have two breasts

2. One of the most extreme boob jobs

Model Sarah Marie Summer - who's addicted to boob jobs The 23-year-old glamour model who has had three surgeries to go up a whopping 18 bra sizes wants to go even bigger

We didn't know this was possible.

Sarah Marie Summer, from Sydney, who is 'addicted to boob jobs' went up 18 cup sizes and has had four boob jobs.

Her boob jobs, which have got her to an M cup, have won her fans and modelling work.

This is one of the most extreme possible boob jobs.

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

3. World's largest natural boobs- 48V

Annie Hawkins-Turner won the Guinness World Record for the biggest natural breasts. Her boobs started developing at the age of nine. She said: ""I just started growing, and kept right on. I started wearing a bra when I was in third grade, and it was a regular grown-up woman's bra. I don't remember ever wearing a training bra.""

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

2038,"The health-focused smartwatch that Apple initially envisioned is not the same one the company will unveil next month, according to a new report.

Apple's original concept for the Apple Watch was one that would track blood pressure, heart activity, stress levels and other functions, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing sources familiar with the device. But none of those features will make it into the final product due to a variety of issues, according to the Journal. Some features didn't work properly. Others proved too complex. And some would have required regulatory approval. As such, Apple was forced to scale back the range and depth of health features for its first entry into the smartwatch arena, the sources said.

Due out in April, the Apple Watch will enter an already crowded playing field, competing with products from Samsung, Sony, Motorola, Microsoft, LG and others. It's been thought that Apple postponed its release of a smartwatch at least in part to perfect the health and fitness monitoring features. But if the Journal's sources are correct, some of those features proved more challenging than expected.

For example, the Journal reported, Apple tested sensors to measure skin conductivity, which would have helped monitor stress levels and heart rate. But the sensors ran into inconsistencies with different people, such as those with hairy arms or dry skin, and the results were mixed based on how tightly you wore the watch, according to the Journal's sources.

Apple also tested ways to check blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood, but again, the results were inconsistent. Further, if those features strayed into the area of actually providing medical advice, they would have required approval from the Food and Drug Administration -- something Apple was trying to avoid.

The difficulties in creating a smartwatch with such features prompted people at Apple to dub the project a ""black hole"" as it sucked in more and more resources, one of the sources said.

As a result, Apple has been touting its first smartwatch as more of an all-purpose wearable. Yes, several key health and fitness features will be available and useful, especially as third-party developers create apps to tap into that market. But Apple is also busy promoting other aspects of the watch, including its variety of styles, its ability to act as an adjunct to the iPhone, its support for Apple Pay and its voice-activated controls.

Will those features and the Apple name convince enough consumers to consider the Apple Watch over the competition? In December, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster projected unit sales of 8 million for 2015. Wall Street has been forecasting sales of 12 million to 15 million. Apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture 5 million to 6 million watches for its first quarter of release.

Whether initial sales are as healthy as expected, Apple will certainly come out with future models. Those could even include some of the health features that didn't pass muster the first time around, the Journal's sources added.

An Apple spokeswoman told CNET that the company declined to comment on rumor or speculation."

2059,"Brain surgery recovery can be a gamble, but not everybody wakes up in the middle of the procedure. Surgeons don’t yet know exactly how the organ works, so it’s always a risk.

Iga Jasica, a 19-year-old Polish girl, woke up while it was happening and gave the surgeons a surprise. The reason for the surgery was to remove a tumor which had apparently been bothering her for a while. It is suspected that the surgeons may have triggered neurons which caused her to regain consciousness and the ability to hear and speak, but not the senses of sight and feeling.

It was also possible that the doctors had given her the anesthetics incorrectly. Fox News claims that investigators are looking into the reason why Jasica spent part of her brain surgery awake. The surgeons may have simply activated the right neurons despite successful administration of anesthesia.

The surprisingly premature brain surgery recovery is a rare situation, and the surgeons said the first thing she did was ask them, “How’s it going?”

Iga Jasica allegedly didn’t appear to wake up in pain, and didn’t sound panicked or frightened. Officials have stated that even though her brain was fully exposed, there was no danger, and her health was not in jeopardy.

The patient reportedly felt so comfortable that as she chatted with the surgeons, Jasica started talking about cats.

After her successful brain surgery recovery, Jasica told the Daily Mail about the experience.

“I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love.

“I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great.”

Spending part of brain surgery awake can be a scary situation, but this time everything turned out fine. It even led to an amusing tale of a 19-year-old girl who got rid of a brain tumor and loves cats.

2065,"The son of an aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s uncle is in hiding in France after evading abduction by agents of the Communist regime, foreign diplomatic sources believe.

“There was an attempt to force him to go back, but it is thought he escaped and is somewhere in France. There is an attempt to locate him but he hasn’t been found yet,” said the diplomatic source.

The architecture student, referred to only by his surname Han, went missing last month, raising concerns for his safety. He is believed to be the son of a close confidant of Jang Song-thaek, Kim Jong-un’s once powerful uncle who was executed in December last year on treason charges. Han's father is known to have been killed recently as part of a Kim regime purge of Jang allies.

Park Sung-jin, Paris correspondent for Yonhap, South Korea’s biggest news agency which broke the story, said: “Since the 1980s, when the regime changes and someone is executed and his relatives and friends and family are studying abroad, they are brought home.

“If Han returned he would likely be kept in a political prison or executed. That has happened many times. He knew what was awaiting him, so he escaped.”

Han’s curious disappearance, which comes amid heightened tensions between North Korea and America over the Sony Entertainment Pictures hacking scandal, has lifted the lid on the murky ties France keeps with the Communist regime.

Despite having no official diplomatic relations with the dictatorship, France has been behind a discreet student programme in place since 2002 in which North Korean students from privileged backgrounds study architecture in Paris. The stated aim is for them to return to Pyongyang and launch grandiose architectural projects to the glory of the dictatorship.

Han was studying at Paris’ prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette. He had left North Korea for Paris in 2012, along with nine other North Koreans, five of whom are posted at another architecture school in Belleville. They are in their third year of a five-year course.

“We didn’t decide out of the blue to take on students from North Korea, the decision was made by the French culture ministry to whom we answer. This is over our heads,” said a head teacher at the La Villette school, who recalled her surprise when the first batch of students turned up wearing badges with the effigy of their “Dear Leader”.

The students are kept under close surveillance, she told The Telegraph.

“There is often an Asian man in a three-piece suit waiting in the courtyard, checking up on attendance and if they get good results,” she said.

“When one failed part of his exam and was sent home, a representative from the North Korean delegation in Paris wanted to take it in his place. We had to explain that wasn’t possible,” she added.

After long denying its existence, the French foreign ministry confirmed to The Telegraph that a “cooperation programme” involving “students from North Korea trained in architecture in Paris” has been in place for the past decade.

It had no further comment.

The programme was set up by Jean-Noël Juttet, a former French ambassador to Japan, who said he was asked by the French foreign ministry to find ways of “maintaining contact between the two countries”.

Homing in on education, he said the French suggested courses in “priority sectors, like medicine, food or construction” but that the North Koreans were only interested in one field: architecture.

“That was a request that came all the way from the top. They insisted so much that we ended up agreeing,” he told Street Press, an online news site that first uncovered the student programme.

Trained in France, the land of star architects like Jean Nouvel, the students are supposed to help transform Pyongyang’s skyline with new, cutting-edge architectural designs, such as the Ryugyong hotel, a 330-metre high edifice completed in 2012. They have reportedly been behind designs for a new ice skating rink, dolphinarium and sports centre opened last year to help North Korea become a “new society of leisure”.

Architecture is not Kim Jong-un’s only area of interest in France. In April, it also emerged that the Emmental-loving despot had ordered three officials to attend a crash course in cheese-making at a dairy school in eastern France - reportedly because he was dissatisfied with his country’s attempts at dairy production. The school politely declined.

France has historically kept relatively warm ties with Communist nations, including China. In 2011, it emerged that a French neurosurgeon, Francois-Xavier Roux, had secretly treated Kim Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, in 2008 after he had a stroke.

Describing Kim as apparently ""profoundly Francophile”, Dr Roux said: ""He wanted to establish political ties with France. He was not hiding that.

""He also knew French cinema very well. I was pretty surprised. He knew French wines pretty well. We were talking about the differences between Bourgogne and Bordeaux, etc.""

Last month, it was reported that Pyongyang flew in a French surgeon to operate on Kim Jong-un’s feet after state media pictured him walking with a cane.

Behind the university exchange lies a complex game of parallel diplomacy, according to North Korea expert Pierre Rigoulot.

“For North Korea, the exchanges are a way of legitimising the Pyongyang regime and receiving recognition. The aim for which they will sacrifice anything is to open an embassy in Paris. It would be a small victory for the country,” he told Street Press.

As for France, he said it was a way of keeping channels of communication open: “You can’t send information to North Korea, so welcoming these young students is a rare opportunity to communicate with the country. In the long term, it could be a way of moving things forward.”

An abduction attempt, however, if confirmed, would “definitively scupper any North Korean request for diplomatic recognition from France,"" he said."
2073,"A 42-year-old Russian fisherman was being mauled by a brown bear when his Justin Bieber “Baby” ringtone saved his life, he believes.

The Daily Mail reports that Igor Vorozhbitsyn had parked his car and was walking towards his favorite fishing spot when the bear attacked him and began clawing his face and chest, but then his phone rang, playing the annoying crescendo of “baby, baby, baby, baby oooh,” and the bear did what any creature with ears would do when it heard Justin Bieber: it fled.

“I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” he said.

The man, who sustained cuts and bruises on his face and chest and was taken to the hospital after other fisherman found him, said he firmly believes if his phone hadn’t rang he would have been killed, marking the first time in written history that someone has been thankful for Justin Bieber’s existence.

— PinkNews (@pinknews) December 15, 2014

“You’re a great teacher and these are just some of the words that I would describe you as: Great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.

“The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave. You don’t have to feel scared because I know that everyone in the class feels the same way as I do.

“PS, We are proud of you.”

Got something in your eye? Here’s the backstory:

The teacher told Pink News he had always felt worried about mentioning his sexuality at the school but was prompted to share it during an anti-bullying week initiative.

He said: “I’d asked who’d heard ‘gay’ being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned.

“Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.”

He says he discussed the matter with the school’s headteacher and they agreed he could tell the class he was gay “so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they’re talking about me.”

The letter came some days later, he explained: “Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys had said during the lesson, ‘It’s just your life’. Then she went back to her maths.”"
2085,"Item: Vancouver Province columnist Tony Gallagher wrote Tuesday that the NHL will expand soon, and that a franchise in Las Vegas is a lock.

Well, we all know about Las Vegas and locks.

Hey, a team in Vegas would be nice because, well, the Seattle Metropolitans are getting ready for their first season in the Western Conference, and Vegas would make 16 teams in the West to balance out the 16 in the East and ...

Oh, wait, you say there's no team in Seattle? But, but, but ... we thought it was getting a franchise this year, too.

Yeah, the crickets are still competing with all the chirping about that, about how the NHL is increasing from 30 ... to 32 ... to 34 ... or more clubs.

Gallagher wrote that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has changed his mind about expansion and is now ready to take the plunge — and that he doesn't have to stop at just two teams.

The NHL adding more than two fits historically. This is how the league has operated the past 40-plus years:

1967: Next Six, to join with the Original Six.

1970-74: Six, to continue Western expansion and to compete with the WHA.

1979: Four, as the league absorbed the surviving teams of the dying WHA.

1991-93: Five, as the Sun Belt strategy took hold.

1998-2000: Four, as part of the league's reunion tour (Atlanta, Minnesota, Ohio).

There are enough worthwhile markets outside Seattle and Las Vegas (Quebec City, Kansas City, Toronto, Hamilton, Portland) to go to 36. Also, Bettman and the owners know they can tap an easy revenue stream (aka franchise fees) if they want/need to pad their cash reserves."
2095,"Remember the crunch of the cornmeal crust? And the stringy cheese, with a slightly sweeter-than normal marinara underneath?

Maybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first, as was the style at the time.

In any case, if you’re a child of the nineties, you remember it well: McDonald’s pizza.



And, like pogs and Beanie Babies, it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood.

Except, in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia, where one hero owner has kept the McDonald’s pizza ovens burning all these years later.

So bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions, because I’m about to tell you where you can still buy McDonald’s pizza.


Neslted on the banks of the Ohio River, along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy, population 1,852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonald’s, located along Main Street on the riverbank, still pumps out pizza — in five minutes or less, of course.



It’s just a seven-and-a-half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic, according to Google Maps.

And, thanks to owner Greg Mills, there’s another McD’s where you can still get a slice, just over ninety kilometres away, across the state border. Spencer, West Virginia also boasts a McDonald’s that’s still lighting the pizza fires — or electrical coils, as the case may be.

According to employee Judy Norman, it’s the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it’s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. She said the location sold 13 pizzas yesterday, but there are “days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza [order].”

Mills, who it’s pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza, couldn’t not be immediately reached for comment, but this post will be updated should he return our calls.



Whatever actually happened to McDonald’s pizza, you ask?

Well, for starters, it turned out adult palates didn’t quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonald’s first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early ’90s, it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey-themed TV ads.



The market for the savoury pie topped $2 billion in the early 90s, according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonald’s pizza. And the company poured $25 million into the ovens alone across Canada, to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the-drive through took over — remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car? — and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging.

So the ovens were scrapped and McDonald’s turned its sights on other gimmicky productions — like the Arch Deluxe, which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing."
2099,"iFans can look forward to the much-awaited smartwatch from Apple making its debut this March if analysts' predictions prove true. That's not all: the 12-inch MacBook Air is also gearing up to launch in the first quarter.

According to a research note from Ming-Chi Kuo, analyst with KGI Securities, the Apple Watch will begin shipping by March. Kuo's forecast is in keeping with recent reports that predict the same release date. He also noted that Apple may hold a special event to unveil the details of the smartwatch, whose specifications are not yet clearly known.

Kuo also predicted that Apple will release the new 12-inch MacBook Air in Q1 2015.

The Apple Watch is also anticipated to sell 2.8 million units in the first quarter -- that is the first month alone -- in the event that there is a March launch.

According to Kuo, shipments in the range of 4 million to 5 million will be seen by most component suppliers in March. However, a few components may also see low production yields, which could affect the assembly and shipping.

Kuo also forecast that the much-rumored 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina display will also ship in the same quarter, which is in synergy with other rumors. A report earlier inJanuary suggested that Quanta Computer, an Apple supplier, was beefing up production of the notebook to meet the Q1 2015 release deadline. The ultra-thin MacBook Air is rumored to tout a fan-less design and pack in the latest low-power processor from Intel (Core M). It is also expected to boast a high resolution Retina display and may be the first to incorporate the USB Type C connector which is reversible. This may also be used for charging the device.

Per Kuo, MacBook Air sales will likely touch the 6 million units sales mark (for the first three months of 2015), which is an increase from the 5.9 million forecast in Q1 2014.

The analyst sees iPhone shipments touch 61.7 million unit sales in Q1 2015. Kuo also anticipates a drop in demand for the iPad as the latest iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 tablets did not create much of a stir in the holiday season."
2105,"A TRANSGENDER teenager who killed herself after her Christian parents refused to accept her has left a heartbreaking suicide note.

Leelah Alcorn, 16, stepped in front of a tractor trailer on a rural highway a few kilometres from her family home in Kings Mill, Ohio.

Her mother posted a tribute to her child on Facebook using her birth name Joshua and not mentioning the suicide.

However, the teen had published a note hours before her death on her Tumblr account explaining in detail why she had chosen to end her life.

She says that she identified as a girl from the age of four and that when she discovered that she could be transgender at aged 14 she “cried of happiness”.

“After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was,” she wrote.

Heartbreakingly, her devout Christian mother, Carla Wood Alcorn, refused to accept her desire to identify as a girl.

She wrote: “I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.”

‘Gay conversion therapy killed my son’

Leelah went on: “If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.”

She was forced by her parents to see a Christian therapist who told her she was selfish and wrong and should seek God’s help. When she didn’t receive her parents’ consent to transition at aged 16 she cried herself to sleep.

She said she turned against her parents, coming out as gay at school but despite positive responses from her friends she continued to be viewed by her mum and dad as “an embarrassment” because she was not “their perfect little straight christian boy (sic)”.

Writing about her reasons for suicide she said: “I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out.”

She ended the note: “My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s f***ed up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.”

In a short Facebook tribute Carla Wood Alcorn ignored her child’s female persona, calling her Joshua and saying she had gone “home to heaven” after she was hit by a truck during “an early morning walk”.

2107,"Christina Fernández de Kirchner, the president of Argentina, got a new addition to her family last week when she adopted a 13-year-old Jewish boy named Yair Tawil as her godson, the Independent reports. Her motivations for doing so are based on a centuries-old legend that seventh sons will transform into werewolves.

In Argentina, the werewolf is referred to as el lobison; in Paraguay it goes by the name Luison, and in Brazil it's called the Lobisomem. The Independent elaborates on the South American legend:

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

In Guaraní mythology, the lobison is the offspring of Tau, an evil spirit, and Kerana, a mortal woman. In the cultures that believe in the lobison, that creature acts as a sort of Grim Reaper, whose mere presence means that death will soon befall those it comes into contact with. As the Independent explains, by the 19th century, fear of this creature was so acute in Argentina that families sometimes murdered their seventh sons to prevent the legend from coming true. So in 1907, in an attempt to stop this practice, the Argentinean president began adopting seventh sons, which the president insisted would stop the curse. In 1973, the Independent adds, the presidential adoption tradition was also extended to seventh daughters.

In addition to being able to say he's the president's godson, Tawil will receive a gold medal and enjoy a full educational scholarship. In modern times, the curse, it seems, is more aptly described as a blessing."

‘At first we couldn’t understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped.

‘In other words, he wasn’t a suitable lover, and we assume that after failing to perform she killed him, probably out of frustration.’

According to The Independent, Argentina's president, President Christina Fernández de Kirchner adopted a boy named Yair Tawil as her godson so that he would not turn into a werewolf. It's actually part of a longstanding tradition in the country that dates back to a folk story in the country:

According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared ""el lobison"". The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy's 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.
Because some people actually believed this hundreds of years ago, they started killing babies. So, to stop that from happening, presidents starting adopting the seventh born boys of families. The practice was later extended to include girls, too. Now, seventh born children not only get the country's president as their new godparent, they also get a gold medal and a scholarship.

According to The Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Tawil is also the first Jewish boy to participate in the adoption tradition:

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.

On Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina's history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a ""magical moment"" with a ""marvelous family."" She described Yair as ""a total sweety,"" and his mother a ""Queen Esther."""

The Islamic State is harvesting human organs to finance its blood-driven caliphate, according to Iraq’s ambassador to the United Nations, urging its Security Council to investigate the issue.

Envoy Mohamed Alhakim called on the 15-member body to look at allegations of organ removal by the Islamic State (formerly ISIS) as bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys were discovered in shallow mass graves.

“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” the envoy, Mohamed Alhakim, said on Tuesday.


“It is clear they are missing certain parts,” the diplomat also noted, adding that a dozen doctors were executed in in northern Iraq, after allegedly refusing to harvest organs of the ISIS victims.

The Islamic State is guilty of “crimes of genocide” of ethnic groups, Alhakim said.

“These terrorist groups have desecrated all human values. They have committed the most heinous criminal terrorist acts against the Iraqi people whether Shi'ite, Sunni, Christians, Turkmen, Shabak or Yazidis,” Iraq’s UN Ambassador said.


After the testimony, the UN envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, then briefed the Council saying that there are numerous reports to support the claim of organ harvesting, which the envoy says is done by the caliphate to finance its cause.

“It’s very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day,” Mladenov said.

“Almost daily terrorist attacks continue to deliberately target all Iraqis, most notably the Shi’ite community, as well as ethnic and religious minorities, across the country,” he told the Security Council, specifying that at least 790 people were killed in January in Iraq.

“Equally worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from (Islamic State) control,” he said.


Looking into the source of ISIS funding, Middle East media outlet, Al-Monitor, claimed that foreign doctors were harvesting organs in Mosul in a report last year based on a medical source.

According to the Iraqi doctor providing the information, otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli, there had been an “unusual movement” in clinics in Mosul, where Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but “prohibited from mixing with local doctors.”


The organs, al-Mosuli told Al-Monitor, were coming from kidnapped individuals, or wounded fighters.

“Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs,” the doctor claimed, accusing “specialized mafia” of being involved internationally.

Organ harvesting news comes as the Islamic State jihadists burnt 45 people alive near the town al-Baghdadi in Western Iraq. It also comes in the footsteps of the recent beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya and the brutal execution of a Jordanian pilot."

A photo depicting what appears to be a 50-foot crab hanging out near a wharf in Kent, England, started making the rounds on the Internet earlier this week. The photo was featured on a local curiosities site called Weird Whitstable, and eventually dubbed ""Crabzilla.""

Quinton Winter, who runs the site, told the Daily Express that he'd spotted a giant crab in the mouth of Kent harbor while on vacation with his son last year. “It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws,"" he said.

""Does this satellite photo of the harbor reveal a giant crab or unusual sand formation?"" Winter asks on his website.

Experts say neither.

""The idea of a giant 'crabzilla' would [be] very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax,"" Dr. Verity Nye, Ocean and Earth Science researcher at Southampton University, told the Daily Mail. ""I don't know what the currents are like around that harbor or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.""

Spider crabs, the largest known to British waters, grow to about 4 feet and inhabit much deeper waters than the those near the pier where Crabzilla is shown lurking.

2158,"The 45-year-old was investigating the devastating terrorist attack at Charlie Hebdo magazine when he killed himself

VIEW GALLERY

A senior French police officer investigating the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre killed himself just hours after the horrific terror attack.

Commissioner Helric Fredou, 45, shot himself in his police office in Limoges last Wednesday night, France 3 reported.

His body was found by a colleague at 1am on Thursday, hours after the terror attack at the satirical magazine's office which left 12 people dead.

It has been reported that shortly before committing suicide Commissioner Fredou had met with the family of one of the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack massacre.

Speaking to Mirror Online, the Union of Commissioners of the National Police confirmed Mr Fredou had committed suicide.

In a statement released after his death, a spokesman for the union said: ""It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning of the death of our colleague Helric Fredou, assigned as Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges.

""On this particular day of national mourning, police commissioners are hit hard by the tragic death of one of their own.

""The Union of Commissioners of the National Police would like to present its most sincere condolences to the relatives of Helric.

""In these difficult times, we have a special thought for all his colleagues.""

Mr Fredou - who was single and had no children - began his career as a police officer in 1997, working in Versailles.

He eventually returned to his home town of Limoges and in 2012 became deputy director of the regional police service.

French media reports suggest he was depressed and was suffering from burnout.

Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi launched last Wednesday's devastating attack at the office's of the French satirical magazine.

The attack left 12 people dead. On Friday, the pair were shot dead by police after taking a man hostage at a family-run printing press in Dammartin-en-Goele .

In a separate incident on Friday, Amedy Coulibaly, 32, took about 15 people hostage in a Paris supermarket.

Four hostages were killed in the incident along with Coulibaly.

2160,"A pregnant woman lost her left eye when cops in Ferguson shot out a car window with a bean bag — sending shards of glass flying into her face, it was revealed on Friday.

Dornella Conner said she and her boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, were “just riding around and respecting Mike Brown” when they stopped at a gas station in the the 10000 block of Halls Ferry early Tuesday, KMOV St. Louis reported.

Once at the gas station, Conner said, police confronted the couple.

“They pulled up while we were coming towards the street,” she told the local TV station. “De’Angelas was trying to get away, they blocked us from the side, front and back.”

But cops are crying foul — they say it was Conner and Lee who were the aggressors during the mayhem after Lee drove the car straight at them, according to KMOV.

That’s when one of the cops fired a specialized bean bag round into the front passenger window, in order to stop the car, police said.

Broken glass went flying into Conner’s face and eyes and she was rushed to a nearby hospital, but doctors were unable to save her left eye.

“Thanks [to] all my Facebook friends for your support,” she wrote Wednesday on Facebook. “Im blind in my left eye and they took it out because i got [shot] in my face … but thank god that i can see the world.”

Conner also remained optimistic for Thanksgiving, but made it clear that she feels the police should pay for what they did.

“Im soo thankful that im here too spend thanksgiving with my family and my kids even tho im still in pain,” she wrote Thursday. “I will have justices for what they did too me but I happy im alive.”

Conner’s father, Donnell, also called for something to be done for what happened to his daughter.

“I’m very upset, very disappointed with tactics that they used trying to get control of the situation,” he told KMOV. “I understand it’s a tough job, I understand that it was chaos, [but] there was no reason to fire upon an innocent person sitting in a vehicle.”"
2179,"If you're an American and you've been watching the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong closely, you may have noticed something familiar: a number of the young demonstrators are using the same ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture that became a symbol of last month's protests in faraway Ferguson, Missouri.


Hong Kong's protesters have good reason to put their hands up: police are using what many observers describe as an unprecedented level of force against the demonstrations, which are rallying against the Chinese government for reneging on its promise to grant them full democracy in 2017. While injuries in the protests have been relatively few so far, the clashes have been bad enough that Hong Kongers appear to earnestly fear the police might crack down violently, and that anxiety is showing in these photos.


It's impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson, or borrowing something they'd seen on the news for their own purposes, or using it coincidentally. But Hong Kongers, particularly young Hong Kongers, pride themselves on being plugged in to the world, so it is well within the realm of possibility that they followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use. Some of the protesters are organized within a group called Occupy Central, named for Hong Kong's Central financial district and for the global protest movement that began with Occupy Wall Street.


It's fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world, however it got there."

By the way, the largest known crab in the world is the Japanese spider crab. But even that one only measures up to about one-fourth the size of this alleged “Crabzilla.” They can measure 12 feet across from claw to claw and weigh up to 40 pounds.

2189,"A five-year-old boy in Torpoint, England, ended up missing a friend’s birthday party, and he did it without any advance notice. Due to his no-show at his friend’s party, the young child was actually given an invoice and billed for his nonappearance.

According to the Plymouth Herald, Derek Nash says that his son Alex was given a “child’s party no show fee” invoice for not going to a friend’s birthday party. The bill for £15.95 (approx. $25) was in his son’s school bag last week and Nash “thought it was a joke.”

The party was scheduled for before the Christmas holidays when Alex was invited to one of his Torpoint Nursery and Infant School classmate’s birthday party. It was being held at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre, and the Nash family indicated that Alex would be attending the party.

“She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.”

As the Metro stated, Nash informed the classmate’s mother in person that his son would be going to the party. It was after that conversation that Nash realized the family already had a family trip planned for that day.

Upon trying to cancel Alex’s acceptance to the party, Nash found no way to contact the party-thrower.

“We did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy’s mother] know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do – he chose to be with his grandparents.”

It was a week later that the invoice for Alex’s no-show was received. A teacher at the Torpoint Nursery and Infant School is actually the one who put the notice in the boy’s school bag, and the school has since issued an apology for their involvement in the matter.

Alex’s teacher said that she would let all staff know that giving the boy an invoice was a “breach of protocol.”

Derek Nash said he then left the school and went to visit the birthday boy’s mother since her address was now on the invoice. He let her know that he “would not be paying her the money” and that “she should have spoken to me first.”

The birthday boy’s mother has since threatened the Nash family with legal action and could possibly take them to small claims court to get the money she is owed.

As for Alex Nash and his classmate at the Torpoint Nursery? He has told his parents that his classmate won’t play with him at school now since he was a no-show to the party and the invoice was given out.

2193,"His gorging has seen him put on so much weight that the tubby tyrant now walks with a limp.

The addicted 31-year-old constantly stuffs his face with the holey Swiss scoff after falling in love with Emmental while he was a student in Switzerland.

A Korean source said: “His intake has increased in recent years with the strain of being in power.”

This has prompted terrified enemies of the regime who have fled North Korea to claim his poor health is down to his expanding waistline.

Kim was spotted limping at a ceremony in the North Korean capital Pyongyang to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of the nation’s founder, his granddad KimIl-sung.

His face looked swollen and he was limping on his right leg, wearing a gloomy expression through the parade.

And Emmental, which is 45% fat, is said to be sending plump Kim to an early grave.

The despot – who rules a country where millions are starving – ordered three officials to attend a crash course in cheese making because he was furious at the quality of dairy products in the Asian state.

But the director of an acclaimed French dairy production college said the request had been “politely but firmly declined”.

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.

""We have bodies. Come and examine them,"" he said. ""It is clear they are missing certain parts.""

He also said a dozen doctors have been ""executed"" in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.

Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of ""crimes of genocide"" in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.

Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that ISIS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that ""it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day."" He used an alternative acronym for the group.

2198,"A 17-year-old transgender girl in Ohio committed suicide by walking into traffic early Sunday morning.

Leelah Alcorn, born Joshua Ryan, left behind a harrowing note posted on Tumblr that exposed the pain, frustration and rejection Leelah felt, including her feeling that “there’s no way out,” and her concern that she would never fully transition.

Leelah died around 2:20 a.m. Sunday after she was hit by a tractor trailer near the  South Lebanon exit of I-71. While initial news reports seemed to suggest her death was an accident, her note made her intentions clear:

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in… because I’m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally “boyish” things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids.

Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more Christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life.

On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

Later, she detailed her emotional turmoil.

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy.

Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse. That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me.

As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year.

I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s fucked up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.

None more so than a particularly demanding Snowy Owl in Poland, who KILLED her new boyfriend because of his tiny penis.

The bird, nicknamed the Black Widow, left her suitor half-eaten, shocking vets at the animal shelter in Knyszynska Forest.

Park keepers had noticed the owl was unhappy and decided to pair her up with a new mate.

But just two days after arriving from Germany, they found the new owl devoured and dead.

Shelter spokesman, Robert Konowal, said: ""The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well.

""We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him.

""At first we couldn’t understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped.

""In other words, he wasn’t a suitable lover, and we assume that after failing to perform she killed him, probably out of frustration.

2222,"Of all the Apple rumors coming out of the Far East recently, the one with the most legitimacy seems to be Apple producing an iPhone with a 4-inch display next year.

Although the reports are unsubstantiated, returning to the small smartphone market would be a good move for Apple.

According to the Electronic Times of Taiwan, the supply chain for Apple production in 2015 includes the components for a smaller handset than the iPhone 6.

The report states that Apple is producing the smaller model “for the convenience of single-handed operation of female users.”

Even though Apple has turned to the larger smartphone and phablet market with the release of the iPhone 5 and 6, respectively, there are still users who prefer the smaller screens and the ability to use a smartphone with just one hand. As phones get bigger, it becomes impossible to do even the simplest tasks without both hands.

The new phone is rumored to be replacing the iPhone 5c model. The 5c has been Apple’s budget model since its release in September 2013.

The 5c lacked many of the features of the 5s model, such as using the Apple 5 model’s A6 chip instead of the A7 that came with the 5s, not having Touch ID, lacking the M7 motion co-processor and other minor features. The iPhone 5c was discontinued in September 2014 when the iPhone 6 was announced.

According to Pocketnow, this rumor might signify that Apple wants to standardize their current iPhone models with a small (4-inch), mid-sized (4.7-inch) and phablet (5.5-inch) display. Whether the new 4-inch iPhone would be marketed as a budget iPhone is impossible to say at this point.

Apple stayed with a 3.5-inch display for five generations as its rivals grew progressively larger. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, said in 2010 that the smaller screen was better because it was easier to “get your hands around it.”

2245,"A giant crab photographed in a harbour mouth in Kent, UK, is proving a great drawcard… for the website that’s claiming it’s a giant crab.

Weird Whitstable curator Quinton Winter believes he lives in the UK’s weirdest town and hosts a collection of pics and reports on his website to prove it.

But even he couldn’t believe this aerial photograph of a 50-foot crab lurking in the shallows off the harbour:


Crab, sandbank, or Photoshopping idiot? Picture: Weird Whitstable
So he went to check it out for himself.

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’,” Winter said.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida claimed to have paid $20,000 for the procedure in an attempt to secure herself a reality show on MTV.

Using an obvious pseudonym, Jasmine Tridevil told an American radio station she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to operate.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

She claims the one who did agree forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to protect his anonymity, because he was ""breaking the code of ethics"".

Tridevil’s dubious story is not helped by the fact that all the available images of her appear to have been taken by herself, with no third parties present, and that the footage she has posted is decidedly grainy.

And now the internet sleuths of Snopes have weighed in with some pretty convincing research that indicates Tridevil may be playing the media. It points out:

'...The JASMINETRIDEVIL.COM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler, and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa-area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler (whose ""Alisha's Golden Touch"" massage web site now bears legends identifying her as ""Provider of internet hoaxes since 2014"" and ""Specialist in massage for three breasted women""). Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the ""third breast"" photos.'

Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.

However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.

She told The Sun (£): “This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people don’t believe it, that’s up to them.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

She also claims her self-financed film crew recorded footage of her operation, adding: “I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don’t really care what people think or say about me.

“I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax.”

Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a ""quick flash"" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

The soldiers told customs agents they were refugees and were trying to cross the Niagara Falls Rainbow Bridge, WCVB reported.

The troops were reported missing after a trip to a shopping mall late Saturday, authorities said. It was the second time in a week that Afghan security trainees in the United States have disappeared.

Earlier this month, two Afghan police officers training with the DEA wandered off during a sightseeing trip to Georgetown, CNN affiliate WJLA reported.

They decided they wanted to stay in the United States, but authorities found them and sent them home.

The three men who went missing in Massachusetts were identified as Afghanistan National Army Soldiers Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Cpt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada, and Cpt. Noorullah Aminyar.

They arrived in the United States on Sept.11 for Exercise Regional Cooperation, an annual event, the guard said, and were quartered at Joint Base Cape Cod.

Troops from six nations are participating in the exercise, which runs through Wednesday and will go on as scheduled, the guard said.

WCVB-TV Boston reports that an unidentified ""high-level law-enforcement source"" told reporter Karen Anderson, that the men were detainedat the Rainbow Bridge Canadian/U.S. border crossing hnear NiagaraFAlls on Monday.

The TV station quotes an unidentified ""high-level law-enforcement source"" for tis reports. The details could not immediately be confirmed.

NBC News, quoting ""top Massachusetts law enforcement officials, also reports the three were detained at the bridge,

The three soldiers from the Afghan National Army arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 11 to take part in a two-week training exercise at Camp Edwards, a National Guard training facility located at Joint Base Cape Cod.

They were last spotted at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis, about 20 miles from the base.

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said Monday that three officers did not appear to pose a threat to the public and may be trying to defect.

The Cape Cod Times, quoting an unidentified spokesman for the U.S. Central Command that is sponsoring the training exercises, reported Monday that the men were on an off-base chaperoned excursion ""to introduce them to cultural aspects of American life"" when they failed to return to base Saturday night.

Speaking to reporters, Patrick said the U.S. military does not believe the three Afghans pose a danger to the public. He said the military is investigating a number of possibilities, including that they ""might be trying to defect.""

The officers, who were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminy, are among 200 soldiers from Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia taking part in the tactical exercises at Camp Edwards.

The Cape Cod Times quotes military officials as saying base and exercise officials are working with local and state authorities to locate the men.

The U.S. Central Command spokesman tells the newspaper that the three — like all participants in the field exercises — do not have access to weapons.

Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady tells Boston.com that not all 200 foreign participants are locked down on the base. The officers, who are cleared by the State Department to participate in the program, are permitted to go to dinner or other activities off-base without restrictions.

The camp is a 15,000-acre area inside Joint Base Cape Cod that includes a replica of a forward operating base used by soldiers in places such as Afghanistan, according to the JBCC website.

Sahady said 15 officers and senior enlisted personnel from Afghanistan were taking part in the annual training program, which has been held since 2004. The two-week exercise is scheduled to end Wednesday.

2308,"Bart didn’t have a cat in hell’s chance of coming back from the grave — but after being buried for five days, he clawed his way back.

The miracle feline’s misfortune started when he was struck by a car and his grief-stricken owner laid him to rest.

“The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbor’s yard — alive!” the Humane Society of Tampa Bay in Florida told ABC7.com.

The badly hurt, weak and dehydrated kitty dug himself out of the grave and crept back slowly.

Bart needed treatment for facial wounds, a broken jaw and a ruined eye — but his owner couldn’t afford a vet, so he took his pal to the Humane Society.

Steward said the principal said threats to another child's safety would not be tolerated – whether magical or not. Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the matter.

""All student stuff is confidential,"" Greer said. She referred a call from the Odessa American to Kermit ISD Superintendent Bill Boyd, who did not return a phone call.

Justin Bieber’s song has saved a Russian man from being mauled by a bear.

Fishing in the Yakutia Republic, Russia, Igor Vorozhbitsyn is lucky to be alive after his Justin Bieber ringtone, Baby, scared off a bear that was attacking him.

""I couldn't believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” Vorozhbitsyn told the Croatian Times.

Vorozhbitsyn, 42, was walking to his angling spot when a bear ambushed him from behind.

""I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I'd marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me,"" he said.

But as the bear clawed Vorozhbitsyn’s face and back his mobile phone rang, the ringtone selected was Justin Bieber’s hit song Baby. Rightly startled, the bear retreated back into the forest.

Vorozhbitsyn was able to call for help on his phone and was rescued by fishermen.

Vorozhbitsyn said he has his granddaughter to thank for his ringtone selection.

2323,"Details surrounding the death of comedian Joan Rivers keep getting more and more suspect.

First there was the report that her personal doctor, an ear, nose, and throat specialist, performed a biopsy on her vocal cords, a procedure experts say should have been performed at a hospital, not an outpatient surgery center such as Yorkville Endoscopy. Rivers reportedly did not consent to the biopsy.

Then it was revealed the clinic doctor who performed Rivers’s endoscopy, gastroenterologist Lawrence Cohen, no longer works for Yorkville. There have been conflicting reports about whether he resigned or was fired. A spokesman for the clinic told The Wrap: “Dr. Cohen is not currently performing procedures at Yorkville Endoscopy, nor is he currently serving as medical director.”

And now, an unnamed source claims Rivers’s personal doctor took a selfie while she was under general anesthesia, according to a report by CNN. Rivers’s doctor remains unnamed, and the alleged selfie has not yet surfaced in news reports.

Rivers entered Yorkville Endoscopy in New York City on Aug. 28 for a procedure to determine why she was hoarse and her throat was sore. She stopped breathing when her vocal cords began to swell during the biopsy and went into cardiac arrest. Rivers was put in a medically induced coma and died at Mount Sinai hospital on Sept. 4 at age 81. Initial autopsy results from the New York Medical Examiner’s Office were deemed inconclusive."

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" said Tridevil.

2355,"Women with attractive eyes may be forced to cover them up under Saudi Arabia's  latest repressive measure, it was reported yesterday.

The ultra-conservative Islamic state has said it has the right to stop women revealing 'tempting' eyes in public.

A spokesperson for Saudi Arabia's Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, said a proposal to enshrine the measure in law has been tabled.

'Tempting' eyes: Muslim women could be forced to cover up even their eyes if a 'right' of the Saudi state is enforced

Women in Saudi Arabia already have to wear a long black cloak, called an abaya, cover their hair and, in some regions, conceal their faces while in public.

If they do not, they face punishments including fines and public floggings.

One report on the Bikya Masr news website suggested the proposal was made after a member of the committee was attracted by a woman’s eyes as he walked along a street, provoking a fight.

The woman was walking with her husband who ended up being stabbed twice in the hand after the altercation.

The virtue and vice committee has repeatedly been accused of human rights violations.

Founded in 1940, its function is to ensure Islamic laws are not broken in public in Saudi Arabia.

In 2002, the committee refused to allow female students out of a burning school in the holy city of Mecca because they were not wearing correct head cover.

The decision is thought to have contributed to the high death toll of 15.

They are also banned from driving by religious edict and cannot travel without authorisation from their male guardians.

In September, a Saudi women sentenced to 10 lashes for defying the driving ban was only spared when King Abdullah stepped in to stop the public flogging.

Also in September, the king announced that women would be given the right to vote for the first time and run in the country's 2015 local elections."

The official told CNN that the response began with a 911 call from the clinic, which was given the highest priority.

The fire department were first to arrive at the clinic, five minutes after the call.

Medical staff were already trying to give Rivers CPR using a defibrillator and a breathing tube.

The firefighters then took over the attempts to revive her.

Two minutes after the firefighters came, an ambulance arrived at the clinic, whose paramedics helped with the CPR.

Almost immediately after that, another Fire Department vehicle arrived with medical aid, making a total of more than 10 people fighting to save her.

Rivers was taken from the clinic to Mount Sinai hospital in Manhattan, where she later died.

New York health authorities have launched an investigation into her death, amid speculation as to the exact nature of the procedure she was undergoing and who was treating her.

A director of the clinic has also resigned in the wake of the celebrity's death.

2359,"Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

We have submitted a request for an interview with Jasmine to verify her claim and have not yet received a response.

A military historian, and popular Twitter microblogger using the handle @ArmedResearch, is reporting a huge explosion of an oil pipeline belonging to Saudi Aramco near Sudair.

With all eyes on Saudi and crude right now, speculation and conspiracy theories immediately emerged on social media concerning the news. Here are two of the most interesting hypotheses I've seen:

This is a way to get oil prices to go back up without the Saudis appearing to give in and defend price by voluntarily cutting supply. A pipeline explosion will automatically decrease production.
The US Elections are over, time for prices at the pump to go back up now. This plays on the long-tenured theory that gasoline prices tend to be lowest right before elections as the incumbent party leverages their power to please the masses.

2383,"Cristina Kirchner, the president of Argentina, has ""adopted"" a Jewish boy in order, according to legend, to prevent him from turning into a werewolf.

Yair Tawil, 21, was born in the Argentine city of Rosario, the seventh son of Shlomo and Nehama Tawil.

Under Argentine legend – which reportedly originated in Tsarist Russia – any seventh consecutive son will grow up to become a werewolf. Any seventh daughter will become a witch.

The belief in the myth was so strong that, centuries ago, the seventh child was often put to death.

In 1907, in a bid to counter the myth, Jose Figeroa Alcorta, then-president of Argentina, became the godfather of José Brost, the seventh son of a Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann who had emigrated from Russia.

In 1973 President Juan Domingo Perón formalised the tradition of presidents becoming godparents to the seventh son or daughter, and a year later the ruling was enshrined in law. Those affected by law 20.843 – ""The Law of Presidential Godfathership"", were entitled to presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until the 21st birthday.

But the ruling only applied to Catholic families, and so in 1993 Mr and Mrs Tawil wrote to the president asking for the honour to be extended to their son, Yair.

The request was denied. But in 2009 the law was changed to apply to all – regardless of their religion.

And just before Christmas, Mrs Kirchner met with Yair, who became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina's history.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a ""magical moment"" with a ""marvellous family."" She described Yair as ""a total sweety,"" and his mother a ""Queen Esther.""

She tweeted that the Tawils ""are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.""

Twitter: Cristina Kirchner - Es una familia muy especial. Tienen como paz, alegría y mucho amor. No es común. Buena vibra. http://t.co/QILUC11xR4

Mrs Kirchner adopted her first ""godson"" in 2008. In 2012 she adopted another, Natanael Eric, who was also born in Rosario, and last year three more boys – all of them born in the northern province of Santa Fe.

The Argentine president had been due to usher in the New Year with a visit to the Vatican, to see her compatriot Pope Francis.

But a fall on Boxing Day, when she slipped on a wet floor in her home, caused her to fracture her ankle.

On Monday it was announced that she had cancelled the trip and suspended official events for the beginning of next month."
2402,"Claim: A ghost ship filled with Ebola-ridden rats is heading towards Florida.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via e-mail, January 2015]

Would like to confirm latest fantastical story making the rounds on Facebook: Ghost ship filled with Ebola-ridden rats heading for Florida.

Origins: On 7 January 2015, the entertainment web site World News Daily Report published an article claiming a ghost ship filled with Ebola-infected rats was heading towards Florida:

A large cargo ship originating from West Africa has the American authorities on high alert as it is approaching the coast of Florida. All 17 crew members of the Guinean Luck are reported to have died from the ebola hemorrhagic fever and the presence of thousands of rats possibly infected with the disease aboard the ship could represent a major threat for the American population.

The ship left Sierra Leone on July 13 2014 in destination of the Mexican city of Tampico. Six days after leaving the port of Freetown, the captain of the ship reported in a radio communication that three of the crew members were beginning to show distressing symptoms that suggested they could be infected with ebola, and that the ship was changing course to head towards Cape Verde to get some medical help. This was the last time that the crew was heard of, and all 17 men on board are presumed to have died in only a few days later.

""We are determined to protect the American population from this unique threat"" says coast guard commander, James Fitzgerald. ""There is no way we are going to let those disease-ridden rats set foot in the USA. We're gonna find that ship and we're gonna sink it!""

The fictitious World News Daily Report article contained fabricated photos, made-up mathematical measurements, and imaginary quotes from invented officials. These dubious details gave the story an air of authenticity, and many readers took to social media to spread news of the ghost ship's impending arrival.

But there is no truth to the above-quoted story. World News Daily Report is a fake news site, and its disclaimer notes all articles published on the web site are for entertainment purposes only:

Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV.

2428,"It wasn’t very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he’d like an epidemic of Ebola.

But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when.

And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?

Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.

And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.

But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldn’t be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside.

A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California’s big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural?

With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing.

At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city.

And Bettman hasn’t been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot.

It’s been 15 years since the NHL expanded — and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced.

And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota.

Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork:

“There’s a lot of interest. We’re hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City,” Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games.

“We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. It’s not something we’ve seriously considered yet.”

Like hell it isn’t. They’d have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously.

And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear — one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix.

But could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True there’s a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise can’t seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all.

And while Kansas City isn’t really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they’re going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen.

Going back to Minnesota has been a success, and there’s no question there’s more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity.

There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if it’s true, after such a long wait this trivial detail — which only troubles the fans — isn’t going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this.

And any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that’s paying their salaries.

Expansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved."
2429,"BUTTE, Montana -

Robert O’Neill, the former United States Navy SEAL who shot and killed Osama Bin Laden, had his home mistakenly invaded by members of a street gang this morning shortly after 1AM. O’Neill was uninjured, the five intruders all suffered injuries and remain hospitalized, but are expected to make a full recovery. Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm.

Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of O’Neill’s.

“Mr. O’Neill had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. O’Neill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. O’Neill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!” commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled.

O’Neill had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist Kevin Williamson interviewed the celebrated war hero.

“It was nothing really. Those kids didn’t have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb,” O’Neill stated.

The neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police. According to the men in custody, the debt was over a $50 bag of marijuana."
2435,"It's a safe bet that Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of Saudi Arabia's religious police, isn't a fan of Cole Porter. ""The lure of you"" is precisely why Nabet announced yesterday that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice will cover any women's eyes that are deemed ""tempting."" ""The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones"" he said. ""[We] have the right to do so.""
What are ""tempting"" eyes? One Saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are ""uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble."" The Orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting, but if they happen to rely on Merriam-Webster, then it means ""having an appeal."" What is an appeal? According to the dictionary, it is ""arousing a sympathetic response."" And what is sympathetic? ""Showing empathy,"" according to Merriam-Webster.

So there you have it. To allow a women's eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world, one must empathize with her very existence. But the religious police--massively funded by King Abdullah--cannot do this. ""It's so stupid,"" the Saudi journalist tells me. ""I don't know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won't be silent.""

Perhaps they won't be, but the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has some of the most powerful backers in the country. Prince Naif, recently appointed heir to the throne, has said: ""The committee is supported by all sides ... It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam.

2439,"The 81-year-old comedienne was supposed to only have a routine procedure at Yorkville Endoscopy Aug. 28, but it took an ultimately fatal turn. Her personal doctor paused to snap a self-portrait while she was under anesthesia, CNN reported.

Joan Rivers’ personal doctor stopped to take a selfie in the procedure room while the famous comedienne was under anesthesia, just moments before she went into cardiac arrest, CNN reported Tuesday.

Rivers, 81, was getting a routine scoping of her throat at Yorkville Endoscopy Aug. 28 when her own physician performed an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords, a source told the Daily News.

The procedure sent the famed funny woman into a death spiral.

A staff member at the Upper East Side clinic told CNN that the personal physician — who was not authorized to practice medicine at the private facility — paused to snap a self-portrait.

Rivers was at the clinic for a routine endoscopy by gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen.

Cohen has since been let go by the clinic. Rivers’ personal physician has not yet been named.

Was Bonet – who played Cosby's daughter, Denise, on The Cosby Show from 1989 to 1992 – addressing the numerous sexual assault allegations against the 77-year-old comedian? (The actor has denied the claims through his lawyer.)

2464,"The cameras on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus may be some of the best on the smartphone market, but they could be trumped by the camera on the next iteration of the iPhone. Though the next phone -- possibly the ""iPhone 6s"" -- isn't expected for another eight months, sources within Apple Inc.’s supply chain in Asia have detailed a “dual-lens” camera module, according to Chinese publication UDN. Such a feature would improve the camera’s low-light performance and could also aid in optical image stabilization.

Apple has long used a single lens with a five-element design on its cameras. Minor camera upgrades on each new generation of iPhone have kept consumers satisfied. But in 2014, the manufacturer introduced a bigger update: optical image stabilization and phase-detection autofocus on the iPhone 6 Plus. The camera on the iPhone 6 Plus in particular is said to be on par with the image quality of point-and-shoot cameras. The iPhone 6 did not get that feature.

Now, Apple may provide the next iPhone with its largest camera upgrade in Apple’s history. Information out of Apple’s Asia supply chain has often been reliable in the past, and tallies with prior reports suggesting that Apple will put a camera in the new iPhone that will rival the image quality of DSLR cameras. Daring Fireball's John Gruber said in November that Apple is working on a “weird two-lens system” for a future iPhone.

Devices like the HTC One M8 include a dual-lens camera, created by the Israeli startup Corephotonics. But Apple usually uses lenses by Sony.

The ""iPhone 6s"" may also implement a feature called Force Touch, according to the Taipei-based touch module supplier TPK. Force Touch lets the Apple Watch interpret different levels of pressure for different actions; a user can press heavily on the smartwatch screen to open an options menu, and then use a light tough to select an option. The Apple Watch is expected to launch sometime in March."

2484,"TORONTO (Reuters) - BlackBerry (BB.TO: Quote) (BBRY.O: Quote) shares rose more than 3 percent on Monday after a news website said Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group (0922.HK: Quote) might offer to buy the Canadian technology company.

Benzinga.com, citing an unnamed source familiar with the matter, said an offer worth $15 a share could come as early as this week.

Lenovo and BlackBerry said their companies did not comment on rumors and speculation.

Rumors of a Lenovo bid for BlackBerry have swirled many times over the last two years. Senior Lenovo executives at different times have indicated an interest in BlackBerry as a means to strengthen their own handset business.

The speculation reached a crescendo in the fall of 2013, when BlackBerry was exploring strategic alternatives.

Sources familiar with the situation however, told Reuters last year that the Canadian government had strongly hinted to BlackBerry that any sale to Lenovo would not win the necessary regulatory approvals due to security concerns.

BlackBerry's secure networks manage the email traffic of thousands of large corporate customers, along with government and military agencies across the globe. Under Canadian law, any foreign takeover of BlackBerry would require government approval under the Industry Canada Act.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper told Reuters in February 2012 that he wanted BlackBerry to grow ""as a Canadian company."" And in December 2011, then-Industry Minister Christian Paradis referred to the company as a ""Canadian jewel.""

Analysts also have said any sale to Lenovo would face regulatory obstacles, but they have suggested that a sale of just BlackBerry's handset business and not its core network infrastructure might just pass muster with regulators.

BlackBerry's long-struggling handset business turned a profit before special items in the last quarter, after the Waterloo, Ontario-based company concluded its three-year restructuring program.

However, BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer John Chen has said he sees the handset business as core to the company for now, as it will foster sales growth over the next few quarters until the software and services business begins to generate new revenue streams in the first half of 2015.

Shares of BlackBerry were up 3.4 percent at $9.81 in early Nasdaq trading. Its Toronto-listed shares were up 3.1 percent at C$11.03.

2522,"The President of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, has adopted a Jewish godson – to prevent him from becoming a werewolf.

Although this sounds like something straight out of a fantasy novel, the President last week met Yair Tawil and his family for the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years and is based on Argentinian folklore.

According to the legend, the seventh son of a family will transform into ‘El Lobison’, a werewolf like creature, on the first Friday after the boy’s 13th Birthday, and will continue to turn into a blood-thirsty, baby eating werewolf every full moon.

The fear of the creature was so fervent in 19th century Argentina that many families murdered or abandoned their seventh born son, forcing the Argentinian government to implement the process of Presidential adoption.

The tradition was established in 1907, and was extended to baby girls in 1973.

Although having seven children is now much rarer than 100 years ago, seventh sons or daughters can now expect to gain the President as their official godparent, as well as a gold medal and educational scholarship.

2541,"PROBLEM: Last year, the average American consumed 247 eggs -- over 40 percent more than the world per-capita average. Because egg yolks are high in cholesterol, eating whole eggs increases cholesterol, a known risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart attacks. Previous research also links CAD with cigarette smoke.

METHODOLOGY: Canadian researchers examined 1,231 patients at London's Health Sciences Centre's University Hospital. The average age of all the patients was 62. Ultrasound measurements of the carotid arteries established the presence and quantity of atherosclerotic plaque, and the scans were accompanied by lifestyle surveys. Smoking was measured in pack-years (number of packs per day multiplied by the number of years spent smoking). Egg yolk consumption was measured in egg yolk-years.

RESULTS: Aging was associated with a linear increase in arterial plaque after age 40, but smoking and egg consumption were each independently associated with an exponential increase in plaque. Egg consumption had two-thirds of the effect of smoking.

CONCLUSION: Egg yolks are almost as bad for your carotid arteries as smoking.

IMPLICATION: While the link between eggs and cholesterol -- and between cholesterol and heart disease -- is well established, this study sheds light on the extent of their potential harm if eaten routinely in large quantities. A single large egg contains more than 180 mg of cholesterol -- more than a third of a person's daily recommended intake. By this measure, a typical American breakfast alone, with two eggs (plus bacon!), would push well past that. Egg whites, meanwhile, remain excellent.

SOURCE: The full study, ""Egg Yolk Consumption and Carotid Plaque,"" is published in the journal Atherosclerosis."
2543,"Conventional medical authorities say that consumption of saturated animal fats is bad for you and causes heart disease.

But a hundred years ago, fewer than than one in one hundred Americans were obese, and coronary heart disease was unknown.

The Procter and Gamble started marketing Crisco as a new kind of food -- the first commercially marketed trans fat. Crisco was originally used to make candles and soap, but with electrification causing a decline in candle sales,

Procter and Gamble decided to promote the fat as a “healthier” all-vegetable-derived shortening

According to LewRockwell.com:

“Feeding high doses of fat and cholesterol to omnivores, like rats and dogs, does not produce atherosclerotic lesions in them ...

In fact, it turns out that people who have highest percentage of saturated fat in their diets have the lowest risk of heart disease ...

The last word on this subject should go to Julia Child ... Enjoy eating saturated fats, they’re good for you!”





Dr. Mercola's Comments:
The demonization of saturated fat began in 1953, when Dr. Ancel Keys published a paper comparing saturated fat intake and heart disease mortality. His theory turned out to be flimsy, to say the least, but the misguided ousting of saturated fat has continued unabated ever since. Fortunately, the truth is finally starting to come out, as medical scientists have begun to seriously question Keys' findings.

Time to Put Ancel Keys' Theory to Rest
Keys based his theory on a study of six countries, in which higher saturated fat intake equated to higher rates of heart disease. However, he conveniently ignored data from 16 other countries that did not fit his theory. Had he chosen a different set of countries, the data would have shown that increasing the percent of calories from fat reduces the number of deaths from coronary heart disease.

And, as illustrated in the featured article, when you include all 22 countries for which data was available at the time of his study, you find that those who consume the highest percentage of saturated fat have the lowest risk of heart disease.

Furthermore, many have now realized that it's the trans fat found in margarine, vegetable shortening, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils that is the true villain, causing far more significant health problems than saturated fat ever could!

Still, despite the scientific evidence, the low-fat dogma remains a favorite among most government health authorities. Case in point: the most recent food chart issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in December of last year, recommends reducing your saturated fat intake to a mere seven percent of caloric intake—down from its previously recommended 10 percent…

Newer Studies Debunk Keys' Theory
The USDA's lowered recommendation is illogical when you consider the evidence available today, which supports saturated fat as a necessary part of a heart healthy diet. For example, as discussed in the featured article, a number of indigenous tribes around the world are living proof that a high-saturated fat diet equates to low mortality from heart disease.

These include:

Tribe Primary Diet Percentage Saturated Fat
Maasai tribe in Kenya/Tanzania Meat, milk, cattle blood 66 percent
Inuit Eskimos in the Arctic Whale meat and blubber 75 percent
Rendille tribe in NE Kenya Camel milk, meat, blood 63 percent
Tokealu, atoll islands in New Zealand territory Fish and coconuts 60 percent
And then there's human breast milk, which contains 54 percent saturated fat. Since breast milk is the most perfect diet in existence for developing infants, the presence of high amounts of saturated fat cannot easily be construed as a ""mistake.""

Furthermore:

A meta-analysis published last year, which pooled data from 21 studies and included nearly 348,000 adults, found no difference in the risks of heart disease and stroke between people with the lowest and highest intakes of saturated fat.
In a 1992 editorial published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, Dr. William Castelli, a former director of the Framingham Heart study, stated:

""In Framingham, Mass., the more saturated fat one ate, the more cholesterol one ate, the more calories one ate, the lower the person's serum cholesterol. The opposite of what… Keys et al would predict…We found that the people who ate the most cholesterol, ate the most saturated fat, ate the most calories, weighed the least and were the most physically active.""
Another 2010 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a reduction in saturated fat intake must be evaluated in the context of replacement by other macronutrients, such as carbohydrates.

When you replace saturated fat with a higher carbohydrate intake, particularly refined carbohydrate, you exacerbate insulin resistance and obesity, increase triglycerides and small LDL particles, and reduce beneficial HDL cholesterol. The authors state that dietary efforts to improve your cardiovascular disease risk should primarily emphasize the limitation of refined carbohydrate intake, and weight reduction.
I believe that last point is very important, and is likely a major key for explaining the rampant increase in obesity, heart disease and diabetes. And once you can pinpoint the problem, turning it all around becomes that much easier.

Carbohydrates, Not Fat, is the Root of Obesity and Heart Disease
Heart disease is so common today, it's hard for people to remember that a mere 100 years ago, this disease was really uncommon.  As Dr. Donald Miller writes in the featured article:

""There were 500 cardiologists practicing in the U.S. in 1950. There are 30,000 of them now – a 60-fold increase for a population that has only doubled since 1950.""

Such an explosion of heart disease indicates that something has changed that is contributing to this epidemic.

What is that ""something""?

Our diet!

Most likely, the studies that have linked the so-called ""Western diet"" to an increased heart disease risk simply confirm that sugar and refined carbohydrates are harmful to your heart health. Because although the Western diet is high in red and processed meats and saturated fats, it's also alarmingly high in sugar and refined carbs like bread and pasta. And, as concluded in the last study listed above, when you reduce saturated fat and increase refined carbohydrates, you end up promoting obesity, heart disease and diabetes...

Gary Taubes has also done an excellent job of explaining the connection between carbs and obesity and its related health issues in his book Why We Get Fat: and what to do about it.

In a nutshell, eating fat and protein does not make you fat—carbohydrates do.I firmly believe the two primary keys for successful weight management and reducing your risk for diabetes, heart disease and other weight-related health problems are:

Severely restricting carbohydrates (sugars, fructose, and grains) in your diet, and
Increasing healthy fat consumption
According to last year's Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the top 10 sources of calories in the American diet are:

Grain-based desserts (cakes, cookies, donuts, pies, crisps, cobblers, and granola bars) 139 calories a day
Alcoholic beverages
Yeast breads, 129 calories a day
Pasta and pasta dishes
Chicken and chicken-mixed dishes, 121 calories a day
Mexican mixed dishes
Soda, energy drinks, and sports drinks, 114 calories a day
Beef and beef-mixed dishes
Pizza, 98 calories a day
Dairy desserts

Looking at this list, it plain to see that CARBS—i.e. sugars (primarily fructose) and grains—are the primary sources of our weight- and health problems, not saturated fats.

(As an update, you've often heard me state that soda is the number one source of calories in the US diet, which it was—based on the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The updated NHANES survey above covers nutritional data from 2005-2006, placing grain-based foods in the top two slots. Still, soda comes in at number four, and I still believe a lot of people, particularly teenagers, probably get a majority of their calories from fructose-rich drinks like soda.)

The Different Types of Fat
Fats can be confusing, but you can generally divide fats into four types:

Saturated fats, from animal fat and tropical oils
Monounsaturated fat, such as olive oil
Polyunsaturated fat, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fats
Trans fats, such as margarine
Sources of healthy fats include:

Olives and Olive oil Coconuts and coconut oil Butter made from raw grass-fed organic milk
Raw Nuts, such as, almonds or pecans Organic pastured egg yolks Avocados
Grass fed meats Palm oil Unheated organic nut oils
Another healthful fat you want to be mindful of is animal-based omega-3. Deficiency in this essential fat can cause or contribute to very serious health problems, both mental and physical, and may be a significant underlying factor of up to 96,000 premature deaths each year. For more information about omega-3's and the best sources of this fat, please review this previous article.

Having the proper balance between omega-3 and omega-6 fats is also very important for optimal health. So in addition to increasing your omega-3 (which most people are sorely deficient in), you also want to decrease your consumption of omega-6, found primarily in:

Corn oil
Soy oil
Canola oil
Safflower oil
Sunflower oil
The ideal ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 is 1:1, but the typical American diet is more like 1:20 in favor of omega-6. The overabundance of these oils in processed foods of all kinds explains our excess omega-6 levels.

The other fats you want to avoid are the trans fats. Trans fats are formed when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil during food processing in order to make it solidify. This process, known as hydrogenation, makes fats less likely to spoil, so foods stay fresh longer, have a longer shelf life and also have a less greasy feel. The end result of the hydrogenation process is a completely unnatural fat that causes dysfunction and chaos in your body on a cellular level.

Your Body NEEDS Saturated Fat for Optimal Function
Saturated fats from animal and vegetable sources provide a number of important health benefits. In fact, your body cannot function without saturated fats! Saturated fats are needed for the proper function of your:

Cell membranes Heart Bones (to assimilate calcium)
Liver Lungs Hormones
Immune system Satiety (reducing hunger) Genetic regulation
Healthy Fat Tips to Live By
So please remember, you do need a certain amount of healthy fat, while at the same time you'll want to avoid the unhealthy varieties. The easiest way to accomplish this is to simply eliminate processed foods, which are high in all things detrimental to your health: sugar, carbs, and dangerous types of fats.

After that, these tips can help ensure you're eating the right fats for your health:

Use organic butter made from raw grass-fed milk instead of margarines and vegetable oil spreads. Butter is a healthy whole food that has received an unwarranted bad rap.
Use coconut oil for cooking. It is far superior to any other cooking oil and is loaded with health benefits. (Remember that olive oil should be used COLD, drizzled over salad or fish, for example, not to cook with.)
Following my nutrition plan will automatically reduce your modified fat intake, as it will teach you to focus on healthy whole foods instead of processed junk food.
To round out your healthy fat intake, be sure to eat raw fats, such as those from avocados, raw dairy products, and olive oil, and also take a high-quality source of animal-based omega-3 fat, such as krill oil."
2544,"We’ve been told that saturated fat is unhealthy.

It is claimed to raise cholesterol levels and give us heart attacks.

However… many recent studies suggest that the true picture is more complicated than that.

This article takes a detailed look at saturated fat and whether it is good or bad for your health.

What is Saturated Fat?

“Fats” are macronutrients.

That is, nutrients that we consume in large amounts and give us energy.

Each fat molecule is made of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids… which can be either saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated.

What this “saturation” stuff has to do with, is the number of double bonds in the molecule.

Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds, monounsaturated fatty acids have one double bond and polyunsaturated fatty acids have two or more double bonds.

This picture here shows the difference:

Saturated vs Unsaturated Fatty AcidsPhoto Source.

Another way to phrase this, is that saturated fatty acids have all their carbon (C) atoms fully “saturated” with hydrogen (H) atoms.

Foods that are high in saturated fat include fatty meats, lard, full-fat dairy products like butter and cream, coconuts, coconut oil, palm oil and dark chocolate.

Actually, “fats” contain a combination of different fatty acids. No fat is pure saturated fat, or pure mono- or polyunsaturated.

Even foods like beef also contain a significant amount of mono- and polyunsaturated fats (1).

Fats that are mostly saturated (like butter) tend to be solid at room temperature, while fats that are mostly unsaturated (like olive oil) are liquid at room temperature.

Like other fats, saturated fat contains 9 calories per gram.

Bottom Line: Saturated “fats” are fats that contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids, which contain no double bonds. Saturated fats are solid at room temperature.
Why do People Think That it is Harmful?

A Single Butter Curl

Back in the 20th century, there was a major epidemic of heart disease running rampant in America.

It used to be a rare disease, but very quickly it skyrocketed and became the number one cause of death… which it still is (2).

Researchers learned that eating saturated fat seemed to increase levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream.

This was an important finding at the time, because they also knew that having high cholesterol was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.

This led to the following assumption being made:

If saturated fat raises cholesterol (A causes B) and cholesterol causes heart disease (B causes C), then this must mean that saturated fat causes heart disease (A causes C).

However, at the time, this was not based on any experimental evidence in humans.

This hypothesis (called the “diet-heart hypothesis”) was based on assumptions, observational data and animal studies (3).

The diet-heart hypothesis then turned into public policy in 1977, before it was ever proven to be true (4).

Even though we now have plenty of experimental data in humans showing these initial assumptions to be wrong, people are still being told to avoid saturated fat in order to reduce heart disease risk.

Bottom Line: Saturated fats have been assumed to cause heart disease by raising cholesterol in the blood. However, no experimental evidence has ever directly linked saturated fat to heart disease.
Saturated Fat Can Raise LDL (The “Bad”) Cholesterol, But Also HDL (The “Good”) Cholesterol

It’s important to realize that the word “cholesterol” is often used inaccurately.

Older Male Doctor

HDL and LDL, the “good” and “bad” cholesterols, aren’t actually cholesterol… they are proteins that carry cholesterol around, known as lipoproteins.

LDL stands for Low Density Lipoprotein and HDL stands for High Density Lipoprotein. All “cholesterol” is identical.

At first, scientists only measured “Total” cholesterol, which includes cholesterol within both LDL and HDL. Later they learned that while LDL was linked to increased risk, HDL was linked to reduced risk (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

“Total” cholesterol is actually a highly flawed marker because it also includes HDL. So having a high HDL (protective) actually contributes to a high “Total” cholesterol.

Because saturated fat raised LDL levels, it seemed logical to assume that this would increase the risk of heart disease. But scientists mostly ignored the fact that saturated fat also raises HDL.

All that being said, new research has shown that LDL isn’t necessarily “bad” because there are different subtypes of LDL (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16):

Small, dense LDL: These are small lipoproteins that can penetrate the arterial wall easily, which drives heart disease.
Large LDL: These lipoproteins are large and fluffy and don’t easily penetrate the arteries.
The small, dense particles are also much more susceptible to becoming oxidized, which is a crucial step in the heart disease process (17, 18, 19).

People with mostly small LDL particles have three times greater risk of heart disease, compared to those with mostly large LDL particles (20).

So… if we want to reduce our risk of heart disease, we want to have mostly large LDL particles and as little of the small ones as possible.

Here’s an interesting bit of information that is often ignored by “mainstream” nutritionists… eating saturated fat changes the LDL particles from small, dense to Large (21, 22, 23).

What this implies is that even though saturated fat can mildly raise LDL, they are changing the LDL to a benign subtype that is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.

Even the effects of saturated fat on LDL aren’t as dramatic as you may think. Although they increase LDL in the short-term, plenty of long-term observational studies find no link between saturated fat consumption and LDL levels (24, 25, 26).

It also seems to depend on the “chain length” of the fatty acid. For example, palmitic acid (16 carbons) may raise LDL, while stearic acid (18 carbons) does not (27).

Now scientists have realized that it’s not just about the LDL concentration or the size of the particles, but the number of LDL particles (called LDL-p) floating in the bloodstream.

Low-carb diets, which tend to be high in saturated fat, can lower LDL-p, while low-fat diets can have an adverse effect and raise LDL-p (28, 29, 30, 31).

Bottom Line: Saturated fats raise HDL (the “good”) cholesterol and change LDL from small, dense (bad) to Large LDL, which is mostly benign. Overall, saturated fats do not harm the blood lipid profile like previously believed.
Does Saturated Fat Cause Heart Disease?

Old Man Taking Pills

The supposedly harmful effects of saturated fat are the cornerstone of modern dietary guidelines.

Because of that, this topic has received enormous amounts of funding.

However… despite decades of research and billions of dollars spent, scientists still haven’t been able to demonstrate a clear link.

Several recent review studies that combined data from multiple other studies, found that there really is no link between saturated fat consumption and heart disease.

This includes a review of 21 studies with a total of 347,747 participants, published in 2010. Their conclusion: there is absolutely no association between saturated fat and heart disease (32).

Another review published in 2014 looked at data from 76 studies (both observational studies and controlled trials) with a total of 643,226 participants. They found no link between saturated fat and heart disease (33).

We also have a systematic review from the Cochrane collaboration, which combines data from numerous randomized controlled trials.

According to their review, published in 2011, reducing saturated fat has no effect on death or death from heart disease (34).

However, they found that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiac events (but not death) by 14%.

This does not imply that saturated fats are “bad,” just that certain types of unsaturated fats (mostly Omega-3s) are protective, while saturated fats are neutral.

So… the biggest and best studies on saturated fat and heart disease show that there is no direct link. It was a myth all along.

Unfortunately, the governments and “mainstream” health organizations seem reluctant to change their minds and continue to promote the old low-fat dogma.

For more, read this review of 5 recent studies on saturated fat and health.

Bottom Line: The link between saturated fat and heart disease has been studied intensely for decades, but the biggest and best studies show that there is no statistically significant association.
Does a Diet Low in Saturated Fat Have Any Health Benefits, or Help You Live Longer?

Frustrated Young Woman With Vegetables on a Plate

Several massive studies have been conducted on the low-fat diet.

This is the diet recommended by the USDA and mainstream health organizations all over the world.

The main purpose of this diet, is to reduce the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol.

This diet also recommends increased consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains… along with reduced consumption of sugar.

The Women’s Health Initiative was the biggest nutrition study in history. It was a randomized controlled trial with 46,835 women, who were instructed to eat a low-fat diet.

After 7.5-8 years, there was only 0.4 kg (1 pound) difference in weight and there was zero difference in heart disease, cancer or death (35, 36, 37, 38).

Other massive studies have confirmed this… the low-fat diet provides no benefit for heart disease or the risk of death (39, 40).

Several studies that replaced saturated fat with polyunsaturated vegetable oils showed that more people in the vegetable oil groups ended up dying (41, 42).

It is interesting to see that since the low-fat guidelines came out, the prevalence of obesity has skyrocketed (43):

Low Fat Guidelines and Obesity Epidemic

This graph shows that the obesity epidemic started full-force at the same time the low-fat advice was peaking. The type 2 diabetes epidemic followed soon after.

Of course, this graph alone doesn’t prove anything (correlation does not equal causation), but it does make sense that replacing traditional foods like butter and meat with processed low-fat foods high in sugar had something to do with it.

It’s also interesting when looking at the literature, that in almost every single study comparing the “expert approved” low-fat diet to other diets (including paleo, vegan, low-carb and Mediterranean), it loses (44, 45, 46, 47).

Bottom Line: Studies on the low-fat diet do not show a reduced risk of heart disease or death and some studies show that replacing saturated fat with vegetable oils increases the risk.
People With Certain Medical Conditions May Want to Minimize Saturated Fat

Suspicious Doctor

The results of most studies are based on averages.

The studies clearly show that, on average, saturated fat does not raise the risk of heart disease.

However, within those averages, there is room for individual variability.

Perhaps most individuals see no effect… while others experience decreased risk and yet others experience an increased risk.

That being said, there are definitely some people who may want to minimize saturated fat in the diet.

This includes individuals with a genetic disorder called Familial Hypercholesterolemia, as well as people who have a gene variant called ApoE4 (48).

With time, the science of genetics will most surely discover more ways in which diet affects our individual risk for disease.

Bottom Line: Some people may want to minimize saturated fat intake, including people with Familial Hypercholesterolemia or a gene called ApoE4.
Saturated Fat is Excellent for Cooking and Foods That Are High in it Tend to be Healthy and Nutritious

Saturated fat has some important beneficial aspects that are rarely mentioned.

Chef Holding Bell Pepper and Meat

For example, saturated fats are excellent for cooking. Because they have no double bonds, they are highly resistant to heat-induced damage (49).

Polyunsaturated fats, on the other hand, easily oxidize when they’re heated (50).

For this reason, coconut oil, lard and butter are all excellent choices for cooking, especially for high-heat cooking methods like frying.

Foods that are naturally high in saturated fat also tend to be healthy and nutritious, as long as you’re eating quality unprocessed foods.

These include naturally fed/raised meats, dairy products from grass-fed cows, dark chocolate and coconuts.

Bottom Line: Saturated fats are excellent cooking fats and foods that are high in saturated fat tend to be both healthy and nutritious.
The “Bad” Fats You Should Avoid Like The Plague

Bottles of Vegetable Oil

There are many different types of fat.

Some of them are good for us, others neutral, yet others are clearly harmful.

The evidence points to saturated and monounsaturated fats being perfectly safe and maybe even downright healthy.

However… the situation is a bit more complicated with polyunsaturated fats.

When it comes to those, we have both Omega-3s and Omega-6s.

We need to get these two types of fatty acids in a certain balance, but most people are eating way too many Omega-6 fatty acids these days (51).

It is a good idea to eat plenty of Omega-3s (such as from fatty fish), but most people would do best by reducing their Omega-6 consumption (52).

The best way to do that is to avoid seed- and vegetable oils like soybean and corn oils, as well as the processed foods that contain them.

Another class of fats, artificial trans fats, is also very harmful.

Trans fats are made by exposing polyunsaturated vegetable oils to a chemical process that involves high heat, hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst.

Studies show that trans fats lead to insulin resistance, inflammation, belly fat accumulation and drastically raise the risk of heart disease (53, 54, 55, 56).

So eat your saturated fats, monounsaturated fats and Omega-3s… but avoid trans fats and processed vegetable oils like the plague.

Bottom Line: The truly harmful fats are artificial trans fats and processed vegetable oils high in Omega-6 fatty acids.
Blaming New Health Problems on Old Foods Doesn’t Make Sense

The health authorities have spent an immense amount of resources studying the link between saturated fat and heart disease.

Despite thousands of scientists, decades of work and billions of dollars spent, this hypothesis still hasn’t been supported by any good evidence.

The saturated fat myth wasn’t proven in the past, isn’t proven today and never will be proven… because it’s just flat out wrong.

Not only is this myth NOT supported by scientific evidence, it is easily refuted with some plain common sense…

Humans and pre-humans have been eating saturated fat for hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of years, but the heart disease epidemic started a hundred years ago.

Blaming new health problems on old foods just doesn’t make sense."
2545," Saturated fats have long been called ''bad fats'' for their effect on the heart. But a new analysis calls into question whether they're really that bad after all.

The findings, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, have sparked renewed debate about fats and heart health.

The new study should trigger a review of current diet guidelines for heart health, according to the researchers who did the analysis. Other experts, including one from the American Heart Association, disagree.

There is some common ground. All agree that dietary fat is just one factor that drives heart disease risk. Paying attention to the other factors is also important.

WebMD asked a study co-author, a cardiologist, a nutrition expert, and the American Heart Association to elaborate.

What did the analysis look at and find?

Researchers looked at 72 published studies on fats and heart disease. The studies involved more than 600,000 people from 18 countries. Some people already had heart disease, while others did not. The researchers reanalyzed the results, an approach called a meta-analysis.

They looked at whether different fats helped or hurt your heart. The different fats included:

Saturated fats (found in meats, whole-fat dairy products, and baked goods)
Polyunsaturated fats, such as omega-3 and omega-6 (found in fish, nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils)
Monounsaturated fats (found in olive and canola oils)
Trans fats (found in fried foods and baked goods, and being phased out of the food supply)
The surprise? Saturated fats, long thought to raise heart disease risks, had no effect. Neither did monounsaturated fats, which are thought to help the heart, says study researcher Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, at the Harvard School of Public Health.

Which fats did have an effect? Trans fats, known to raise bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol, were linked with a higher risk of heart disease, as expected. Omega-3s from food helped. Omega-6s appeared to help.

What do the researchers say about the findings?

Nutritional guidelines on fats and heart health by such organizations as the American Heart Association may deserve another look, the study authors say.

The focus should move beyond just the fat content of food, Mozaffarian says. ""We can't judge the healthfulness of a food [only] by how many grams of saturated fat it has. We really should be moving toward a food-based analysis.

""It's not just the fat grams, and the type of food, but the way the food is processed,"" he says. For instance, the analysis found that a type of saturated fat linked with milk and dairy products reduced heart disease risk.

Based on the analysis, Mozaffarian and his colleagues say, the current heart health guidelines that promote eating more foods with omega-3s and omega-6s and less of those with saturated fats are not needed.

What do others say?

Other experts find fault with the study and its conclusions.

""Mainly I think the findings should be disregarded,"" says Walter Willett, MD, chair of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. While the analysis suggests that ''saturated fat is not quite as bad as its reputation, it depends on what you compare it to,"" he says.

""If you replace saturated fat with carbohydrates or refined starch or sugar, you are not changing your heart disease risk,"" he says. ''If you replace saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, you do get a reduction in heart disease risk.""

One analysis is not enough to change dietary advice, says James Blankenship, MD, director of cardiology at Geisinger Medical Center.

In the analysis, the researchers themselves cite a number of caveats and limitations, such as study participants self-reporting their fat intake.

In response to the study, the American Heart Association says its guidelines remain the same. For heart health, it recommends a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, nuts, and unsaturated fats.

Less than 6% of the diet should include saturated and trans fats, the association says.

Is there some common ground about how to protect heart health?

Yes.

Judging how heart-healthy a food is must take more than fat into account, Mozaffarian says. For instance, a lower-fat meat that is processed is not heart-healthy, he says.

Willett agrees. ""It's important to look at single nutrients, but also at whole food groups,"" he says. Blankenship offers these steps proven to benefit the heart:

Get regular exercise -- at least a half-hour a day.
Maintain a healthy body weight.
See your doctor and find out your heart disease risk. Know your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
""Don't spend so much time looking at food labels,"" Blankenship says. Instead, he says, go to the grocery store's produce department and load up.

If cholesterol and saturated fat don't play as large a role as we thought in heart disease, what's behind the heart disease problem?

Multiple factors, Blankenship says. They include obesity, genetics, sedentary lifestyles, diabetes, and high blood pressure. A poor diet drives risk, he says, ""but it's not the only thing.""

Mozaffarian reports receiving fees from Bunge, Pollock Institute, Quaker Oats, Life Sciences Research Organization, Foodminds, Nutrition Impact, Amarin, Astra Zeneca, Winston and Strawn LLP, and UpToDate, and serving on the scientific advisory board for Unilever North America.

The study was funded by the British Heart Foundation, the Medical Research Council, Cambridge National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, and Gates Cambridge."
2546,"Poor old saturated fat. For over forty years now, it’s been spoken of only in hushed tones, dissed as nothing but artery clogging, obesity-causing poison. This “common sense fact” has become so widely accepted that a lot of people who want to improve their diet start by purchasing skim milk, ditching their egg yolks, and beginning a life free of steak, pork, and butter.

It’s time to bring bacon back to breakfast. After all, saturated fat is good for you.

We’ve Made a Huge Mistake

But we all make mistakes. This one started in 1970, with the first publication of “The Seven Countries Study .” The research looked at the incidences of saturated fat intake and heart disease among 12,763 men from (you guessed it) seven different countries, and showed a correlation between the two.

Unfortunately, the study was deeply flawed: It didn’t take into account important factors like smoking rates, sugar consumption, and exercise levels, and it left out an awful lot of data from other countries that contradicted the conclusions. The study’s authors actually had access to twenty-two countries’ data, and didn’t discuss any of the populations that followed diets with plenty of saturated fat and barely experienced any heart disease. Such communities include the Kenyan Masai, the Tokelau in Polynesia, and the Arctic Inuit.

Governments followed by making the supposed saturated fat-heart disease connection a matter of public health policy, an ideology which probably culminated with the abominable food pyramid of the 1990s — which recommended up to 11 servings of rice and pasta per day, and about as little fat as possible.

The result? In the past 30 years in the United States, the amount of calories from consumed fat has fallen from 40 percent to 30 percent, while obesity has doubled and heart disease has remained the country’s number one killer.

But the spread of obesity has no single cause; there are a lot of complicated factors that have led to America’s health crisis. To figure out whether saturated fat should be added back into our diets, let’s take a closer look at its effect on the body.

Why Saturated Fat Doesn't Cause Heart Disease

In a 2010 evaluation of 21 studies and 350,000 subjects, saturated fat was not associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease — and numerous other studies have reached similar conclusions        . Of course, these studies aren’t without controversy. For instance, Greatist expert and physician Dr. James Hardeman believes those 21 studies aren’t comprehensive enough; on average, their subjects were studied for around 14 years, which may not be long enough to see the effects of a diet high in saturated fat. However, they raise important questions about saturated fat’s effects on the arteries of the heart and brain.


PIN IT
But what about cholesterol? We actually have two kinds of cholesterol in our blood: the HDL (“good”) and LDL (“bad”). Total cholesterol levels are less important than the ratio of HDL to LDL, but a simpler (if kind of flawed) approach is that we should try to increase HDL and decrease LDL. Saturated fat is generally believed to increase the bad cholesterol.

But that’s only part of the story, because there are also two kinds of LDL cholesterol: big, floaty particles (type A) and small, dense ones (type B). When someone reduces their consumption of saturated fat and their LDL cholesterol “drops,” they’re only lowering their type A particles. But it’s the type B particles that are more closely linked in heart disease, and they’re generally controlled by carbohydrate consumption . So the best way to cut out harmful types of cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease could be to follow a diet that’s low in carbs, rather than fat        .

Why Saturated Fat Can Be Good For You

Saturated fat has been shown to have loads of positive effects on the body, including:

Liver Health: Saturated fat encourages the liver cells to dump their fat cells, which helps the liver to function more effectively  .
Immunity: Saturated fatty acids, especially the kinds found in butter and coconut, help white blood cells to recognize and destroy invading viruses and bacteria. Go get ‘em, boys!
Hormones: Eating saturated fat tends to increase free testosterone levels, which helps to repair tissue, preserve muscle, and improve sexual function  .
Now, fat is high in calories, so it can promote weight gain in that respect. Per gram, it has more than twice the calories of protein or carbohydrates. But provided an eye is kept on portion size, saturated fat in and of itself doesn’t have any negative impact on the body. In fact, increasing fat intake might help with weight loss: One study found that when three groups of obese people were fed diets of 90 percent fat, 90 percent protein, and 90 percent carbohydrates, respectively, the high-fat group lost the most weight . Plus, it tastes freaking delicious.

DROP THAT HOT DOG!

This doesn’t mean every source of saturated fat is healthy. Case in point: A study from the Harvard School of Public Health found that after analyzing the diets of 1.2 million people, there was no association between eating red meat and heart disease — but there was for those who ate a lot of processed meat . That is to say, if we’re going to get sick from eating meat or saturated fat, it’ll be by getting it from a crappy source.

Basically, we should spend a little more on food. The body loves saturated fat, but from sources like grass-fed meat and butter, whole eggs, and coconut fat — not hot dogs and pepperoni pizza (sorry). By a mile, the biggest enemy in our food is likely refined sugar . Even the American Heart Association, which is still anti-saturated fat, agrees that sugar is a far bigger contributor to heart disease.

But the tide is very slowly starting to turn. Prominent journals and scientists are beginning to speak out on saturated fat’s benefits, and, after government scientists reviewed 16,000 studies on diet and obesity, Sweden recently became the first Western country to advocate a high-fat diet to its citizens.

That’s because heart disease and obesity are caused by inactivity, trans fats, refined carbs, and overeating, to name a few — but not saturated fat. Toss the margarine and tuck into some buttered vegetables or a seared steak. We think you deserve it."
2547,"Saturated fat has been a controversial subject in recent years, with some research suggesting that it may not be as bad for health as once thought. But a new study published in The BMJ dashes any hope that butter is actually back.

Cutting down on saturated fatty acids—found in animal foods, like dairy and meat, as well as palm and coconut oil—may lower risk of coronary heart disease, according to researchers. And swapping these foods for unsaturated fats (from vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, avocados, and seafood, for example), whole grains, and plant-based proteins (think lentils and edamame) seems to boost heart health even further.

The new findings are significant because saturated fat has been a source of debate: Studies have shown that saturated fatty acids can affect cholesterol, but there's hasn't been any definitive research linking them to overall heart health. A large meta-analysis published this summer, for example, found that butter consumption does not appear to raise heart disease risk.

The current U.S. Dietary Guidelines have taken a conservative approach to saturated fats, saying they should make up no more than 10% of total calories. Qi Sun, MD, assistant professor of nutrition in the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and senior author of the new study, says his group’s findings back up this advice.

RELATED: 13 Healthy High-Fat Foods You Should Eat

The new study also bolsters government recommendations for “eating an overall healthful diet,"" Dr. Sun told Health—one that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, vegetable cooking oils rich in polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats (the two main types of unsaturated fats), nuts, legumes, fish, and low-fat dairy.

To determine saturated fat’s long-term effects on heart health, he and his colleagues followed more than 73,000 women and 42,000 men for an average of 26 years, collecting data on their diet and health every four years.

After controlling for factors such as age, ethnicity, and other potential influencers, the researchers found that participants who consumed the most calories from four commonly consumed saturated fatty acids—lauric acid, myristic acid, plametic acid, and stearic acid—were 18% more likely to develop coronary heart disease over the course of the study than those who consumed the least.

Some researchers have suggested putting individual limits on each of these fatty acids, said co-author Frank Hu, PhD, professor of nutrition and epidemiology, in a press release. But that’s not practical, he argues, since they share many of the same food sources: red meat, dairy fat, butter, lard, and palm oil.

RELATED: Good Fats, Bat Fats: How to Choose

Instead, it is healthier to focus on lowering total saturated fat intake, says Hu. In fact, the researchers estimated that replacing just 1% of those fats with the same number of calories from poly- or monounsaturated fats (think avocado and nuts), whole grains, or plant-based proteins could reduce heart disease risk by 4% to 8%.

The study specifically recommends swapping animal fats (butter and lard) with vegetable oils high in unsaturated fat; and points out that restaurant food, and snacks and bakery items—including crackers, chips, popcorn, cakes, and cookies—can be high in saturated fat.

The researchers also offer some insight as to why prior studies haven't always shown a clear link between less saturated fat intake and better heart health. Often, the authors say, people who cut back on saturated fat replace those calories with low-quality carbs, like processed food and refined flour. These are associated with health risks of their own, and likely cancel out any health benefits.

RELATED: The 22 Worst Foods for Trans Fat

This is the largest observational study to-date to examine the association between specific saturated fatty acids and the risk of coronary heart disease, say the authors, and its results are in line with previous research that has focused specifically on healthy swaps.

While the findings aren’t terribly surprising, they do serve one important purpose: As Hu put it, “this study dispels the notion that ‘butter is back.'"""
2549,"It is hailed as the best way to get fit, with celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Katie Holmes purporting to be fans.

High intensity training - or HIIT as it is known -  is a form of strength training that involves the repetition of short bursts of activity or weight training.

2556,"President Donald Trump has reportedly told multiple people in private that he will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement.

Though Trump has publicly said he has not yet made up his mind, Axios reports he has privately told several people of his decision, including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.

The outlet spoke with three sources who confirmed the information, though Trump has been known to change his mind at the last minute.

Trump tweeted Saturday morning to say he would announce his 'final decision' on whether or not the US will stay in the Paris agreement next week despite coming under intense pressure from world leaders at the G7 in Sicily.

'I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!' he wrote.

The president earlier declined to comment about the accord, as he refused to give into intense international pressure.

Within the Environmental Protection Agency, staffers are quieting down on public lobbying and Pruitt will have fewer television appearances about the issue so that the withdrawal will be 'the President's victory', according to Axios.

There are also concerns within the EPA that Trump could be influenced by the pressures he received overseas, according to the outlet. Earlier Saturday, the other members of the G7 voted to abide by the Paris climate agreement, according to a person familiar with the talks. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter before the formal announcement.

The leaders attempted to convince Trump for three days - first in Brussels at meetings of NATO and the European Union, then in Sicily for G7, but the former reality television host left Italy without making clear where he stands.

Under the G7 agreement, the Trump administration will be given more time to consider whether it will remain committed to the 2015 Paris deal to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.

Backing out of the climate accord had been a central plank of Trump's campaign and aides have been exploring whether they can adjust the framework of the deal even if they do not opt out entirely."
2558,"A proposed secret communications back channel between Donald Trump's team and the Kremlin was reportedly intended to allow sensitive discussions about strategy in Syria, it was reported last night.

Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, was revealed to have proposed setting up the secret line in a meeting with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, at Trump Tower in December.

The back channel was intended to connect Michael Flynn, who was at the meeting and later became Mr Trump's first National Security Adviser, with Russian military leaders, the Associated Press reported. It came as the nascent Trump administration was developing its Syria policy before his inauguration. The communications would have used Russian diplomatic facilities and bypassed the US intelligence services.

Such a system was never established and after Rex Tillerson became Secretary of State the idea was reportedly dropped as Mr Trump's team decided to communicate with Moscow through more official channels.

The discussion of a back channel involving Mr Kushner was first revealed by the Washington Post late on Friday. US officials reportedly learned about it by monitoring Russian communications. Mr Kislyak was said to have been ""taken aback"" by Mr Kushner's proposal.

It also emerged Mr Kushner had at least three interactions, including two phone calls, with Mr Kislyak, during and after the election, that had not been previously disclosed. The discussions reportedly focused on fighting terrorism and improving US-Russian economic relations

Mr Kushner's lawyer Jamie Gorelick said: ""Mr Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings. He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.""

She said Mr Kushner could not remember any calls with Mr Kislyak before the election. She added: ""Mr Kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period.""

According to Reuters Mr Kushner also met Sergei Nikolaevich Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned bank Vnesheconombank and a trained intelligence officer appointed by Vladimir Purin, at Trump Tower in December. The bank is under US sanctions.

The White House declined to answer questions about Mr Kushner's meeting with Mr Kislyak.

But H.R. McMaster, who replaced Mr Flynn as National Security Adviser  said so-called ""back-channeling"" was completely normal. Asked if it would concern him if someone in the Trump administration tried to set up a back channel with the Russian embassy or the Kremlin, he replied: ""No"".

He said: ""We have back-channel communications with any number of individual countries. What that allows you to do is communicate in a discreet manner.""

Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee which is investigating any links between the Trump campaign and Russia, asked the campaign to produce all Russia-related documents, including phone records and emails, dating back to its official start in June 2015."
2569,"You don't have to look hard to find genetically modified food on supermarket shelves: More than 85 percent of the corn and soy grown in the United States comes from seeds whose DNA has been rejiggered (to increase yields), and those two crops play starring roles in countless processed foods, from soda to salad dressing to bread. Advocates say genetically modified (GM) foods allow farmers to produce more with fewer chemicals—which means a cleaner environment and cheaper groceries for us all. But the question remains: What impact do GM foods have on our health?

The answer is, no one really knows. GM foods have been on the market only since 1994, and research on their long-term effects on humans is scarce. To date most of the studies have been done on animals; worryingly, though, some of those studies link GM foods to altered metabolism, inflammation, kidney and liver malfunction, and reduced fertility. In one experiment, multiple generations of hamsters were fed a diet of GM soy; by the third generation, they were losing the ability to produce offspring, producing about half as many pups as the non-GM soy group.

In addition, allergy sufferers worry that, as genes are transferred between plants, allergenic proteins (from, say, peanuts or wheat) will pop up in unexpected places (like soy or sugar). Richard Goodman, PhD, a professor of food science and technology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a former scientist for Monsanto, says that seed companies run sophisticated tests to prevent that kind of mistake from happening. But inserting new genes into a seed's delicately constructed genome is always a gamble because scientists can't predict all the consequences. There is, for example, the possibility of creating brand-new allergens.

Despite the potential health implications, more GM foods appear each year. In 2011 the USDA approved the planting of genetically enhanced sugar beets (sucrose) and alfalfa (hay for livestock). The FDA is expected to okay a fast-growing salmon in the near future. And possibly on the horizon: pigs designed to produce omega-3s.

Yet because GM foods are not required to be labeled as such, it's impossible for consumers to tell them apart from regular foods. Gary Hirshberg, chairman and cofounder of Stonyfield, the organic yogurt company, thinks that's not right. Last October he partnered with Just Label It, a national coalition of nearly 450 organizations that's currently petitioning the FDA to give consumers a choice. More than 600,000 people have already signed. (To add your name, go to justlabelit.org.)

""The status quo is innocent until proven guilty,"" says Ashley Koff, a registered dietitian who studies GM foods, ""as it was for trans fats, DDT, and countless other harmful chemicals. A labeling requirement would motivate seed companies to prove to consumers that their products are safe, to protect their sales."" Nearly 50 other countries—including China, Brazil, and most European nations—have mandated that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) be marked, and in an MSNBC online poll, 96 percent of more than 45,000 respondents said that they should be labeled. At press time, 18 states had introduced legislation to promote GMO labeling.

Hirshberg, for one, remains impatient. ""I'm 57,"" he says. ""I don't want to wait another 30 years to see what the science says. At this point, I want to decide for myself."" "
2570,"Over the past few years, a number of countries have completely banned GMOs and the pesticides that go along with them, and they are doing so for a reason. The latest country to consider a complete ban is Russia after top government scientists recommended at least a 10 year ban.

The truth is, we don’t know enough about GMOs to deem them safe for human consumption. Believe it or not the very first commercial sale of them was only twenty years ago. There is no possible way that our health authorities can test all possible combinations on a large enough population, over a long enough period of time to be able to say with absolute certainty that they are harmless.

There are a multitude of credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why GMOs should not be consumed, and more are emerging every year.  There are also a number of scientists all around the world that oppose them.

By slipping it into our food without our knowledge, without any indication that there are genetically modified organisms in our food, we are now unwittingly part of a massive experiment.The FDA has said that genetically modified organisms are not much different from regular food, so they’ll be treated in the same way. The problem is this, geneticists follow the inheritance of genes, what biotechnology allows us to do is to take this organism, and move it horizontally into a totally unrelated species. Now David Suzuki doesn’t normally mate with a carrot and exchange genes, what biotechnology allows us to do is to switch genes from one to the other without regard to the biological constraints. It’s very very bad science, we assume that the principals governing the inheritance of genes vertically, applies when you move genes laterally or horizontally. There’s absolutely no reason to make that conclusion – Geneticist David Suzuki

If anybody ever tells you that we know with one hundred percent certainty that GMOs are totally safe to eat, they haven’t done their research. There is no reason GM foods should be approved safe for consumption, we just don’t know enough about them. We could easily feed the planet through organic, GMO free methods, there is absolutely no reason we need GM foods around.

Below I’ve presented just a bit of information to get you started on your research if you’re interested.

1. Multiple Toxins From GMOs Detected In Maternal and Fetal Blood

Research from Canada (the first of its kind) has successfully identified the presence of pesticides -associated with genetically modified foods in maternal, fetal and non-pregnant women’s blood. They also found the presence of Monsanto’s Bt toxin. The study was published in the Journal Reproductive Toxicology in 2011.(1) You can read the FULL study here.

“Given the potential toxicity of these environmental pollutants and the fragility of the fetus, more studies are needed, particularly those using the placental transfer approach. Thus, our present results will provide baseline data for future studies exploring a new area of research relating to nutrition, toxicology and reproduction in women. Today, obstetric-gynecological disorders that are associated with environmental chemicals are not known.  Thus, knowing the actual concentration of genetically modified foods in humans constitutes a cornerstone in the advancement of research in this area.” (1)

The study used blood samples from thirty pregnant women and thirty non-pregnant women. The study also pointed out that the fetus is considered to be highly susceptible to the adverse affects of xenobiotics (foreign chemical substance found within an organism that is not naturally produced.)  This is why the study emphasizes that knowing more about GMOs is crucial, because environmental agents could disrupt the biological events that are required to ensure normal growth and development.

2. DNA From Genetically Modified Crops Can Be Transferred Into Humans Who Eat Them

In a new study published in the peer reviewed Public Library of Science (PLOS), researchersemphasize that there is sufficient evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments carry complete genes that can enter into the human circulation system through an unknown mechanism.(2)

In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA.  The study was based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies. PLOS is an open access, well respected peer-reviewed scientific journal that covers primary research from disciplines within science and medicine. It’s great to see this study published in it, confirming what many have been suspected for years.

“Our bloodstream is considered to be an environment well separated from the outside world and the digestive tract. According to the standard paradigm large macromolecules consumed with food cannot pass directly to the circulatory system. During digestion proteins and DNA are thought to be degraded into small constituents, amino acids and nucleic acids, respectively, and then absorbed by a complex active process and distributed to various parts of the body through the circulation system. Here, based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies, we report evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments which are large enough to carry complete genes can avoid degradation and through an unknown mechanism enter the human circulation system. In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA. The plant DNA concentration shows a surprisingly precise log-normal distribution in the plasma samples while non-plasma (cord blood) control sample was found to be free of plant DNA.” (2)

This still doesn’t mean that GMOs can enter into our cells, but given the fact GMOs have been linked to cancer (later in this article) it is safe to assume it is indeed a possibility. The bottom line is that we don’t know, and this study demonstrates another cause for concern.

3. New Study Links GMOs To Gluten Disorders That Affect 18 Million Americans

This study was recently released by the Institute for Responsible Technology (IRT), and uses data from the US department of Agriculture, US Environmental Protection Agency, medical journal reviews as well as other independent research. (3)(4) The authors relate GM foods to five conditions that may either trigger or exacerbate gluten-related disorders, including the autoimmune disorder, Celiac Disease:

Intestinal permeability
Imbalanced gut bacteria
Immune activation and allergic response
Impaired digestion
Damage to the intestinal wall
The Institute for Responsible technology is a world leader in educating policy makers and the public about GMO foods and crops. The institute reports and investigates on the impact GM foods can have on health, environment, agriculture and more.

4. Study Links Genetically Modified Corn to Rat Tumors

In November 2012, The Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology published a paper titled ‘Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize’ by Gilles-Eric Seralini and his team of researchers at France’s Caen University. (5)

It was a very significant study, which obviously looks bad for the big bio tech companies like Monsanto, being the first and only long term study under controlled conditions examining the possible effects of a diet of GMO maize treated with Monsanto roundup herbicide.

This study has since been retracted, which is odd, because the journal it was published in is a very well known, reputable peer reviewed scientific journal. In order for a study to be published here it has to go through a rigorous review process.

It’s also important to note that hundreds of scientists from around the world have condemned the retraction of the study. This study was done by experts, and a correlation between GMOs and these tumors can’t be denied, something happened.

The multiple criticisms of the study have also been answered by the team of researchers that conducted the study. You can read them and find out more about the study here.

GM Crop Production is Lowering US Yields and Increasing Pesticide Use

5. Glyphosate Induces Human Breast Cancer Cells Growth via Estrogen Receptors

A study is published in the US National Library of Medicine (4) and will soon be published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology. Several recent studies showed glyphosate’s potential to be an endocrine disruptor. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere with the hormone system in mammals. These disruptors can cause developmental disorders, birth defects and cancer tumors. (6)

Glyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone-dependent breast cancer. We found that glyphosate exhibited a weaker estrogenic activity than estradiol. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the additive estrogenic effects of glyphosate and genisein which implied that the use of contaminated soybean products as dietary supplements may pose a risk of breast cancer because of their potential additive estrogenicity. (6)

Researchers also determined that Monsanto’s roundup is considered an “xenoestrogen,” which is a foreign estrogen that mimics real estrogen in our bodies. This can cause a number of problems that include an increased risk of various cancers, early onset of puberty, thyroid issues, infertility and more.

6. Glyphosate Linked To Birth Defects

A group of scientists put together a comprehensive review of existing data that shows how European regulators have known that Monsanto’s glyphosate causes a number of birth malformations since at least 2002. Regulators misled the public about glyphosate’s safety, and in Germany the Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety told the European Commission that there was no evidence to suggest that glyphosate causes birth defects. (7)

Our examination of the evidence leads us to the conclusion that the current approval of glyphosate and Roundup is deeply flawed and unreliable. In this report, we examine the industry studies and regulatory documents that led to the approval of glyphosate. We show that industry and regulators knew as long ago as the 1980s and 1990s that glyphosate causes malformation – but that this information was not made public. We demonstrate how EU regulators reasoned their way from clear evidence of glyphosate’s teratogenicity in industry’s own studies to a conclusion that minimized these findings in the EU Commission’s final review report (7)

Here is a summary of the report:

Multiple peer-reviewed scientific literature documenting serious health hazards posed by glyphosate
Industry (including Monsanto) has known since the 1980?s that glyphosate causes malformations in experimental animals at high doses
Industry has known since 1993 that these effects could also occur at lower and mid doses
The German government has known since at least 1998 that glyphosate causes malformations
The EU Commission’s expert scientific review panel knew in 1999 that glyphosate causes malformations
The EU Commission has known since 2002 that glyphosate causes malformations. This was the year DG SANCO division published its final review report, laying out the basis for the current approval of glyphosate
Another study published by the American Chemical Society, from the university of Buenos Aires, Argentina also showed that Glyphosate can cause abnormalities.(8)

The direct effect of glyphosate on early mechanisms of morphogenesis in vertebrate embryos opens concerns about the clinical findings from human offspring in populations exposed to glyphosate in agricultural fields (8)

7. Study Links Glyphosate To Autism, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s

When you ingest Glyphosate, you are in essence altering the chemistry of your body. It’s completely unnatural and the body doesn’t resonate with it. P450 (CYP) is the gene pathway disrupted when the body takes in Glyphosate. P450 creates enzymes that assist with the formation of molecules in cells, as well as breaking them down. CYP enzymes are abundant and have many important functions. They are responsible for detoxifying xenobiotics from the body, things like the various chemicals found in pesticides, drugs and carcinogens. Glyphosate inhibits the CYP enzymes. The CYP pathway is critical for normal, natural functioning of multiple biological systems within our bodies. Because humans that’ve been exposed to glyphosate have a drop in amino acid tryptophan levels, they do not have the necessary active signalling of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is associated with weight gain, depression and Alzheimer’s disease. (9)

8. Chronically Ill Humans Have Higher Glyphosate Levels Than Healthy Humans

A new study out of Germany concludes that Glyphosate residue could reach humans and animals through feed and can be excreted in urine. It outlines how presence of glyphosate in urine and its accumulation in animal tissues is alarming even at low concentrations. (10)

To this day, Monsanto continues to advertise its Roundup products as environmentally friendly and claims that neither animals nor humans are affected by this toxin. Environmentalists, veterinarians, medical doctors and scientists however, have raised increasing alarms about the danger of glyphosate in the animal and human food chain as well as the environment. The fact that glyphosate has been found in animals and humans is of great concern. In search for the causes of serious diseases amongst entire herds of animals in northern Germany, especially cattle, glyphosate has repeatedly been detected in the urine, feces, milk and feed of the animals. Even more alarming, glyphosate was detected in the urine of the farmers.  (10)

9. Studies Link GMO Animal Feed to Severe Stomach Inflammation and Enlarged Uteri in Pigs

A study by scientist Judy Carman, PhD that was recently published in the peer reviewed journal Organic Systems outlines the effects of a diet mixed with GMO feed for pigs, and how it is a cause for concern when it comes to health. (11) Scientists randomized and fed isowean pigs either a mixed GM soy and GM corn (maize) diet for approximately 23 weeks (nothing out of the ordinary for most pigs in the United States), which is unfortunately the normal lifespan of a commercial pig from weaning to slaughter. Equal numbers of male and female pigs were present in each group. The GM diet was associated with gastric and uterine differences in pigs. GM pigs had uteri that were 25% heavier than non-GM fed pigs. GM-fed pigs had a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation with a rate of 32% compared to 125 of non-GM fed pigs.

The study concluded that pigs fed a GMO diet exhibited a heavier uteri and a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation than pigs who weren’t fed a GMO diet. Because the use of GMO feed for livestock and humans is so widespread, this is definitely another cause for concern when it comes to GMO consumption. Humans have a similar gastrointestinal tract to pigs, and these GM crops are consumed widely by people, especially in the United States.

10. GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety. (12)(13)(14)

Deficiencies have been revealed numerous times with regards to testing GM foods.

The first guidelines were originally designed to regulate the introduction of GM microbes and plants into the environment with no attention being paid to food safety concerns. However, they have been widely cited as adding authoritative scientific support to food safety assessment. Additionally, the Statement of Policy released by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, presumptively recognizing the GM foods as GRAS (generally recognized as safe), was prepared while there were critical guidelines prepared by the International Life Sciences Institute Europe and FAO/WHO recommend that safety evaluation should be based on the concept of substantial equivalence, considering parameters such as molecular characterization, phenotypic characteristics, key nutrients, toxicants and allergens. Since 2003, official standards for food safety assessment have been published by the Codex Alimentarius Commission of FAO/WHO. Published reviews with around 25 peer-reviewed studies have found that despite the guidelines, the risk assessment of GM foods has not followed a defined prototype.(12) (15)

“The risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) crops for human nutrition and health has not been systematic. Evaluations for each GM crop or trait have been conducted using different feeding periods, animal models and parameters. The most common results is that GM and conventional sources include similar nutritional performance and growth in animals. However, adverse microscopic and molecular effects of some GM foods in different organs or tissues have been reported. While there are currently no standardized methods to evaluate the safety of GM foods, attempts towards harmonization are on the way. More scientific effort is necessary in order to build confidence in the evaluation and acceptance of GM foods.” (12) (15)

So, if anybody ever tells you that GMOs are completely safe for consumption, it’s not true. We just don’t know enough about them to make such a definitive statement. A lot of evidence actually points to the contrary.

2574,"“My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks.”
- Rod Wheeler, former DC homicide investigator

Wheeler made his comments on the possible Rich-Wikileaks connection in a story first reported Monday night by Fox 5 DC.

In an appearance on Fox News' ""Hannity"" Tuesday night, Wheeler said a ""federal investigator that was involved on the inside of the case"" saw Rich's computer and the case file.

Wheeler told host Sean Hannity the investigator ""came across [as] very credible. When you look at that, with the totality of everything else that I found in this case, it’s very consistent for a person with my experience to begin to think, 'Well, perhaps there were some email communication between Seth and Wikileaks.'""

But a spokesman for Rich's family on Tuesday said Wheeler was not authorized to speak for the family and called assertions Seth Rich sent emails to WikiLeaks ""unsubstantiated."" Brad Bauman said even if purported emails were to surface, it would not necessarily mean Rich had helped WikiLeaks.

""Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so,"" Bauman said. ""We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers.""

Although Bauman said Wheeler was paid by a third party, the family is named as clients of Wheeler's Capitol Investigations on a contract signed by Rich's father, Joel Rich.

The family has been sensitive to speculation that Rich could have leaked emails damaging to the DNC since he was murdered during the height of the presidential campaign in a case that remains unsolved. Wheeler and the federal investigator insist that there is evidence to back their claims.

An FBI forensic report of Rich's computer -- generated within 96 hours after Rich's murder -- showed he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time, the federal source told Fox News.

“I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.

The revelation is consistent with the findings of Wheeler, whose private investigation firm was hired by a third party on behalf of Rich’s family to probe the case.

“My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” Wheeler said. “I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters.”

The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.

On July 22, just 12 days after Rich was killed, WikiLeaks published internal DNC emails that appeared to show top party officials conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the party’s presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning as DNC chairperson.

WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange has stopped short of identifying Rich as the source of the emails, but has taken a keen interest in the case, and has not denied working with Rich.

“WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich,” the organization announced.

Assange has not returned a series of recent emails from Fox News about Rich. MacFadyen, who was considered a mentor by Assange, died of lung cancer on Oct. 22 at age 76.

Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department has no suspects and no substantial leads as to who the killer or killers may be, sources close to the investigation said. Metropolitan Police, including the police chief, have refused to discuss the case, despite requests from Fox News dating back 10 months.

The department released a statement on the case saying it remains an active investigation and that detectives are working with Rich's family.

""If there are any individuals who feel they have information, we urge them to call us at (202) 727-9099 or text us at 50411,"" read the statement. ""The department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information on this case that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.""

The FBI’s national office declined to comment, but sources said the bureau provided cyber expertise to examine Rich’s computer.

D.C. police have announced a $25,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich’s killer. Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman has offered a separate $130,000 reward."
2575,"The life of Seth Rich, a 27-year-old Democratic National Committee staffer, ended nearly a year ago when he was shot to death near his house in Washington, DC. Then came the tragic and bizarre afterlife: Since July, Rich has been the focus of intense right-wing conspiracy theories that have only escalated as the Trump administration’s scandals have deepened.

As the police have repeatedly stated, there is no evidence that Rich’s death was anything other than the consequence of a botched robbery. But some people, especially on the right, believe Rich was murdered by the Clintons for knowing too much about something. The most recent theories claim that Rich, not the Russians, was responsible for leaking the emails, published in WikiLeaks, that revealed Democratic party leaders had talked disparagingly about Bernie Sanders.

Thanks to an erroneous Fox News story last week, which was finally retracted on Tuesday, Rich recently became the focus of an intense media blitz from conservative outlets — many of which were eager for something to talk about besides the scandals swirling around Donald Trump.

Fox News’s Sean Hannity was one of the most enthusiastic rumormongers, devoting segments on three separate occasions last week to Rich. Even after Fox News retracted its story, Hannity promised he would continue to investigate. “I retracted nothing,” he said defiantly on his radio show Tuesday.

Rich’s family has been begging right-wing news outlets to stop spreading unfounded rumors about him, but by now the situation seems to have gotten out of control.

In death, Rich has become a martyr to the right, buoyed by a host of characters each with their own ulterior motives: There is WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who wants to downplay the connections between WikiLeaks and the Russians; there are the Clinton haters, who want to spread the idea that the Clintons are murderers; there are the Trump supporters, who want to minimize the idea that Russian hackers helped deliver the election to their candidate; and there are the talking heads on Fox News, who last week needed something other than negative Trump stories to make conversation about.

We might not know who killed Seth Rich, but we do know who turned his legacy into a textbook study of where fake news comes from, how it spreads, and the victims it creates.

Seth Rich was murdered in a senseless act of violence
Seth Rich worked in Democratic politics for most of his career. He grew up and went to college in Omaha, Nebraska, where as a student he volunteered on two Democratic Senate campaigns. After graduating, he moved to Washington, DC, for a job at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a progressive opinion research and consulting firm. He was later hired by the Democratic National Committee, where he worked on a project to help people find where to vote.

On Sunday, July 10, Rich was shot to death about a block from where he lived in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of DC. Gunshot detection microphones place the time of the shooting at around 4:20 am. Rich had last been seen at around 1:30 am leaving Lou’s City Bar in Columbia Heights, about a 40-minute walk from where he lived.

It is unclear exactly what happened during those three intervening hours. The Washington Post reported that, according to his parents, cellphone records show that Rich called his girlfriend at 2:05 am and talked to her for more than two hours. He hung up just minutes before he was shot.

The police found Rich on the sidewalk with multiple gunshot wounds, at least two in the back. He still had his watch, his cellphone, and his wallet. There were signs of a struggle: bruises on his hands, knees, and face, and a torn wristwatch strap. According to the police report, he was still “conscious and breathing.” Family members say they were told that Rich was “very talkative,” though it is not publicly known if he was able to describe his assailant or assailants. Rich died a few hours later in the hospital.

The police suspected Rich had been the victim of an attempted robbery. Bloomingdale is a gentrifying part of Washington that still suffers from violent crime. In 2016, there were 24 reported robberies with a gun that occurred within a quarter-mile of the street corner where Rich was shot.

The first conspiracy theories grew out of the “Clinton body count” rumor
Almost immediately after news of Rich’s death, conspiracy theories began circulating on social media. A few factors helped make Rich a target of speculation:

The murderers left behind Rich’s valuables. (Though, by that same paranoid logic, wouldn’t a professional hitman have taken Rich’s wallet and phone in order to make it look like a regular mugging?)
Rich worked at the DNC, where in December there had been a minor scandal involving a software glitch that allowed the Bernie Sanders campaign to access private voter data collected by the Clinton campaign.
Hillary Clinton had just clinched the nomination after a surprisingly bruising primary, and there were still sore feelings in the air.
There’s a long-running conspiracy theory that the Clintons have assassinated dozens of their political enemies.
If those facts don’t seem to add up to a coherent story, well, you’re thinking too hard. Conspiracy theories don’t operate logically. They start from an assumption — for instance, “the Clintons are shady” — and spiral outward in search of corroboration.

On Reddit, for instance, one user wrote a 1,400-word post listing things that he found “suspicious.” Here were some of the stray facts the redditor claimed were evidence of a hit job by the DNC or the Clintons:

Rich’s former employer, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, once did some consulting work for British Petroleum. (“Is it possible that Mr. Rich was aware of the public's disdain for oil industry/fracking?”)
Rich once worked on Ben Nelson’s campaign for senator. (“[Nelson] contributed a crucial vote to help pass Obamacare back in 2009.”)
The political conventions were coming up. (“The TIMING of this tragedy seems too 'coincidental’”)
It’s unclear what any of these facts have to do with the Clintons, but somehow the Reddit user concluded: “given his position & timing in politics, I believe Seth Rich was murdered by corrupt politicians for knowing too much information on election fraud.”

Others on Twitter and the trolling website 4chan also speculated that Rich might have crossed the Clintons in some way. Rich’s death seemed to fit in with the “Clinton body count” theory, which dates to the 1990s and claims that the Clintons are so vindictive that they hire hitmen to murder people they don’t like.

People who believe the Clintons are murderers often point to deputy White House counsel Vince Foster, who suffered from clinical depression and died of a gunshot wound to the mouth in 1993. Several investigations all ruled Foster’s death a suicide, but some conservatives insisted there must have been foul play. They claimed that Foster, who was looking into the Clintons’ taxes, may have uncovered evidence of corruption in connection to the Whitewater controversy, a guilt-by-association scandal involving friends of the Clintons’.

The “Clinton body count” theory has endured over the years simply because people don’t live forever. Any time someone dies who was connected to the Clintons — and since Bill Clinton was the president of the United States, literally thousands of people were in his orbit — this theory is dredged up again by the tinfoil hat crowd. And then it slowly fades.

At first it seemed the speculation about Seth Rich would die down quickly as well. But then 12 days later, on July 22, WikiLeaks published thousands of private emails from the DNC, and Rich became a politically useful distraction.

Julian Assange and WikiLeaks supercharged the Seth Rich rumors
A month before Rich was murdered, the DNC admitted that Russian hackers had broken into its computer network, gaining access to all of the DNC’s emails. The thought of Russian interference in American politics was infuriating to Rich, according to one person “who was very close” to him, the Washington Post reported: “It was crazy. Especially for Seth. He said, ‘Oh, my God. We have a foreign entity trying to get involved in our elections?’ That made him so angry.”

When WikiLeaks released its dump of DNC emails on July 22, the obvious explanation was that it had obtained those emails from the Russian hackers. This connection was later confirmed by top US intelligence agencies, who concluded “with high confidence” that DNC servers were hacked by top Russian government hackers, who had then given the emails to WikiLeaks. “Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity,” the US intelligence report explained, as well as for its connection to the Russian propaganda outlet Russia Today.

But WikiLeaks has repeatedly denied its ties to Russia, and ever since last summer it has used Seth Rich as a way to distract from claims that it abetted Russian interference in the US election. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had his own reasons to fear a Clinton presidency — as secretary of state, Clinton wanted to indict Assange for his involvement in releasing the millions of US diplomatic cables leaked by Chelsea Manning.

On Dutch television in August 2016, Assange hinted that Rich, not Russia, may have been the source for the WikiLeaks emails. ""Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material, and often very significant risks,” he said. “As a 27-year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.""


“Was he one of your sources then?” the anchor asked.

“We don’t comment on who our sources are,” Assange replied.

“Then why make the suggestion about a young guy being shot in the streets of Washington?” the anchor replied.

Pressed repeatedly for clarification, Assange concluded that “others, others have suggested that. We’re investigating to understand what happened in that situation with Seth Rich. I think it’s a concerning situation; there’s not a conclusion yet.”

As part of its “investigation,” WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 prize in August for information about Rich’s murder.

This is the point where Seth Rich became a prop in a game of international espionage.

Trump supporters and the alt-right amplified the theory that Rich was some kind of Democratic whistleblower or leaker, even though the facts didn’t really fit this pattern. He didn’t have access to the DNC emails, and he had never shown any prowess at hacking — being a data analyst involves a very different set of skills. Besides, the DNC wasn’t the only organization that was hacked: Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s personal emails, for instance, were stolen separately, as were the emails at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Nevertheless, many on the right were inspired by the WikiLeaks insinuations and started to concoct their own conspiracy theories about Rich’s murder. In August, former House speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich told a conservative talk show host that Rich’s death was suspicious. “First of all, of course it’s worth talking about,” he said. “And if Assange says he is the source, Assange may know. That’s not complicated.”

That same month, Trump adviser Roger Stone claimed, without evidence, that Rich was murdered “on his way to meet with the FBI to discuss election fraud.”

To Trump supporters, the claim that Rich had been murdered by the Clintons had twofold appeal: It reinforced the rumor that the Clintons were shady operatives, and it distracted from the mounting evidence that Russia had interfered with the US election — possibly in collusion with the Trump campaign.

In the presidential debate on September 26, Trump famously suggested that it could have been a lone hacker who was responsible for the stolen DNC emails. ""It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds,"" he said.

Thanks to a weird miscommunication, the conspiracy theory comes back in May
After the election, the conspiracy theories about Seth Rich faded from public consciousness, as the focus turned instead to the FBI’s investigation of connections between Trump staffers and Russian agents. Suspicions still bubbled in right-wing corners of Reddit and on alt-right websites like Gateway Pundit, and Assange continued to claim that it wasn’t the Russians who provided the hacked emails — but most of America had moved on.

But Rich returned to the news last week, when the local TV station FOX 5 DC aired an interview with private investigator Rod Wheeler, who claimed that sources in the FBI told him there was evidence of a connection between Rich and WikiLeaks:

FOX 5 DC: You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...

WHEELER: For sure...

FOX 5 DC: ...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?

WHEELER: Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.
Conservative media outlets jumped on the story, which aired the night of Monday, May 15. By Tuesday morning, conservative outlets like Breitbart, the Blaze, and the Daily Caller all had their own pieces relaying Wheeler’s claims.

On Tuesday, Fox News added its own revelation: It claimed that an unnamed “federal investigator” had confirmed that Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks. “I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,” the source said, according to Fox News. Fox News additionally claimed this source had evidence that Rich had given thousands of DNC emails to WikiLeaks.

This was a two-source story: The report also said that Wheeler had independently corroborated what the anonymous “federal investigator” had told Fox News.

But here’s where it gets confusing. By Tuesday afternoon, Wheeler told CNN that he had misspoken. It turns out he didn’t have any evidence of his own.

What had happened, apparently, was that earlier in the week, Fox News had contacted Wheeler for its own story on Rich. That was when Wheeler learned that Fox News had a source alleging there was contact between Rich and WikiLeaks. When Wheeler went on local TV on Monday night to talk about Rich, he believed he was giving viewers a “preview” of the Fox News story set to run on Tuesday.

That, at least, is how Wheeler explained the situation to CNN last Tuesday. Somehow, through miscommunication or sloppy reporting, the Fox News report used Wheeler to back up its claims about the Rich-WikiLeaks connection. This was incorrect, Wheeler said. He had no independent knowledge.

""I only got that [information] from the reporter at Fox News,"" he told CNN.

Yesterday, after leaving it up for a week, Fox News finally retracted its Seth Rich story, which was down to one anonymous source. “The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting,” an editor’s note explained. “Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.”

Conservative media has a field day
It’s unlikely that any of this would have been a big deal had there not been a stunning series of damaging reports about Donald Trump last week.

Among other things, it was revealed that Trump had shared state secrets with the Russians, that he had pressured FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation into ties between Trump affiliates and Russia, and that the Russia probe had reached a current high-level White House official, who many suspect is Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

One way the conservative media minimized all the bad news was to focus on other stories. The latest Seth Rich allegations became a welcome distraction from the constant revelations coming out of the Washington Post and the New York Times.

For instance, while most outlets were covering the revelation that Trump had volunteered classified information to Russians, the alt-right website Breitbart devoted its front page to the Seth Rich conspiracy. Breitbart even slammed the mainstream media for ignoring the rumors about Rich: “Silence from Establishment Media over Seth Rich WikiLeaks Report” was the title of one story.

Fox News in particular devoted outsize attention to the Rich story, repeatedly rehashing the conspiracy theory. On his 10 pm show, Fox pundit Sean Hannity devoted segments to Rich on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday last week. “I'm not backing off asking questions even though there is an effort that nobody talk about Seth Rich,” he said on Friday night.

On Tuesday, even after Fox News retracted the story that ignited the latest round of speculation, Hannity remained convinced that the Seth Rich conspiracy theory had legs. “I am not Fox.com or FoxNews.com,” he said on his radio show. “I retracted nothing.”

Later that evening, on his television show, Hannity said that for now, he would stop talking about Rich “out of respect for the family's wishes.” On Twitter, though, he was defiant, claiming that “liberal fascism” was trying to silence his voice.

“Ok TO BE CLEAR, I am closer to the TRUTH than ever,” he tweeted. “Not only am I not stopping, I am working harder.”

“Please retweet,” he added.

Rich was an unlucky victim of the conservative media
The recent attention has reignited the old Seth Rich conspiracy theories, bringing forth even more unsubstantiated claims.

On Fox News’s Sunday morning talk show, Newt Gingrich repeated his belief that Rich, not Russia, was responsible for the DNC hack. “It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians,” he said. “It was this young guy who, I suspect, was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee.”

On Monday, Assange issued a cryptic tweet using the hashtag “#SethRich” which fanned the flames even further: “WikiLeaks has never disclosed a source. Sources sometimes talk to other parties but identities never emerge from WikiLeaks. #SethRich.”

And on Tuesday, New Zealand file-sharing entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, who is wanted by the US government for copyright infringement and racketeering, claimed that Rich had personally contacted him in 2014, and that the two had talked about “a number of topics including corruption and the influence of corporate money in politics.”

“I know that Seth Rich was involved in the DNC leak,” Dotcom wrote in a statement.

Rich’s family has repeatedly asked news outlets to stop publicizing these rumors. “Those theories, which some reporters have since retracted, are baseless, and they are unspeakably cruel,” Mary and Joel Rich wrote in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday evening.

“Imagine that instead, every call that comes in is a reporter asking what you think of a series of lies or conspiracies about the death,” they wrote. “That nightmare is what our family goes through every day.”

The Riches also pushed back on some of the rumors themselves, stating that the FBI had found no evidence of communication between their son and WikiLeaks, and that Seth had no access to any of the DNC emails that were leaked:

Despite these facts, our family’s nightmare persists. Seth’s death has been turned into a political football. Every day we wake up to new headlines, new lies, new factual errors, new people approaching us to take advantage of us and Seth’s legacy. It just won’t stop. The amount of pain and anguish this has caused us is unbearable. With every conspiratorial flare-up, we are forced to relive Seth’s murder and a small piece of us dies as more of Seth’s memory is torn away from us.
But to conspiracy theorists, the facts have never mattered. Fake news always has ulterior motives, and everybody who amplified the Seth Rich conspiracy theories had their own stake in keeping the lies alive."
2578,"With Hurricane Matthew wreaking havoc, the Left is predictably seizing the storm as a means of promoting their radical global warming agenda. Climate change has not been a major theme this election cycle, but Hillary Clinton is now trying to turn it into one, with the help of global warming guru Al Gore. Unfortunately for the climate change alarmists, despite all the celebrity endorsements and high-minded rhetoric, the facts keep getting in the way. Here are nine things you need to know about the climate change hoax.

1. The Climategate scandal proved that key data involving man-made climate change was manipulated. In 2009, the public discovered emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit exposing how scientists who have been enormously influential in promoting the concept of man-made climate change actually attempted to cook the books to obtain results that served their narrative that the planet was heating at a dangerous trend due to higher levels of carbon dioxide.

One of these scientists included Dr. James Hansen, a former NASA climatologist who is known by some as the ""father"" or ""grandfather"" of the climate change myth, as it was his ""Model Zero"" that first introduced the concept of global warming. Hansen, Philip Jones, Michael Mann, et al. were all involved in trying ""to lower past temperatures and to 'adjust' recent temperatures upwards, in order to convey the impression of an accelerated warming,"" according to the leaked emails. The emails also revealed how this cabal of scientists would discuss various ways to stonewall the public from seeing the ""background data on which their findings and temperature records were based,"" even going as far as deleting significant amounts of data. They would engage in efforts to smear ""any scientific journal which dares to publish their critics' work.""

2. The Climategate scandal was given new life in 2011, with the release of new emails. The new round of leaked emails at the time provided more teeth to the revelations of 2009. Here are a couple of egregious emails from Jones found, via Forbes:

“I’ve been told that IPCC is above national FOI [Freedom of Information] Acts. One way to cover yourself and all those working in AR5 would be to delete all emails at the end of the process,” writes Phil Jones, a scientist working with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in a newly released email.

“Any work we have done in the past is done on the back of the research grants we get – and has to be well hidden,” Jones writes in another newly released email. “I’ve discussed this with the main funder (U.S. Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy about not releasing the original station data.”

An email written by Mann showed that he tried to get ""an investigative journalist to investigate and expose"" a climate skeptic scientist named Steven McIntyre.

3. NASA may have also been involved in manipulating data to serve the narrative of man-made climate change. The Washington Times reported in 2009: ""Under pressure in 2007, NASA recalculated its data and found that 1934, not 1998, was the hottest year in its records for the contiguous 48 states. NASA later changed that data again, and now 1998 and 2006 are tied for first, with 1934 slightly cooler.""

Since this occurred at around the same time as the Climategate scandal, Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute filed a lawsuit to get NASA to release their relevant data sets on this issue and was able to expose emails from NASA that revealed a disturbing fact: the agency admitted ""that its own climate findings were inferior to those maintained by both the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit,"" reported Fox News in 2010 – meaning NASA climate change data sets were less accurate than the organization embattled with manipulating data sets.

A 2015 Washington Times editorial also highlighted another example of NASA cooking the books:

Paul Homewood, a skeptical researcher, found that in Paraguay, temperature readings for the 20th century at all nine weather stations supervised by NASA had been “adjusted” to transform a cooling trend into a warming trend. His analysis of readings in the Arctic found that rapid warming between 1920 and 1950 — before human activity could have increased the production of greenhouse gases — were adjusted downward so that the 1980s and ‘90s temperatures would stand out as warmer.

4. NASA also declared 2014 to be the hottest year on record – despite the fact that they were only 38 percent sure about it. The latter fact was left out of their press release at the time, as well as the fact that 2014 was supposedly hotter than the previous hottest year, 2010, by 0.02C – well within the margin of error of 0.1C that scientists tend to adhere by. The Washington Post attempted to spin in favor of NASA by arguing that NASA simply said that 2014 was the most likely hottest year on record – but their press release unequivocally stated that ""2014 was the warmest year on record"" and leaving out the aforementioned key facts makes such a declaration seem misleading, as it's clearly not a guarantee that 2014 was even likely the hottest year on record.

5. There is no evidence that the Earth has been warming in recent years. As The Daily Caller highlights, a recent peer-reviewed study concluded that when accounting for El Ninos and La Ninas – which are the ""the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east-central Equatorial Pacific"" that ""occur on average every two to seven years,"" according to NOAA – there has been a flat-line temperature trend since 1997. In fact, the study found that the El Ninos and La Ninas disproved the existence of the Tropical Hot Spot, which the Environmental Protection Agency claimed as evidence of carbon dioxide supposedly warming the atmosphere.

6. The left likes to claim that 97 percent of scientists support the concept of man-made climate change. It's likely closer to 43 percent. The 97 percent myth stems from a variety of flawed studies, as the Daily Wire explained here. On the other hand, the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency conducted a survey in 2015 that found that only 43 percent of scientists believe in man-made climate change, which is far from a consensus.

7. The amount of Arctic sea ice has become quite high. Data from the Danish Meteorological Institute shows that the ""average [ice] extent over the month [of September] is one of the highest in the last decade,"" according to Paul Homewood. This runs directly counter to the predictions of the climate change models.

8. Money from the federal government and leftist organizations fuel a lot of misinformation from man-made global warming alarmists.  Climate change alarmism is an extremely lucrative industry. All in all, there have been over $32.5 billion of federal government grants that have funded climate change research from 1989-2009, far more than any research funded by the oil industry. National Review reports:

Last summer, a minority staff report from the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works gave details on a “Billionaire’s Club” — a shadowy network of charitable foundations that distribute billions to advance climate alarmism. Shadowy nonprofits such as the Energy Foundation and Tides Foundation distributed billions to far-left green groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, which in turn send staff to the EPA who then direct federal grants back to the same green groups. It is incestuous. It is opaque. Major media ignored the report.

Mann, one of the scientists mentioned earlier for his role in the Climategate scandal, received nearly $6 million in grants from the federal government. The sources of funding for scientists like Hansen are unknown, the federal government has been resisting Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to reveal them.

9. It is patently absurd to link Hurricane Matthew to climate change. Not just because of the aforementioned reasons, but because as Marco Morano points out at Climate Depot, ""The data show for the last 10 years we have had an unusual drought of landfalling major hurricanes (Category 3 and higher) on the continental U.S.""

""That’s right, no major hurricanes have made landfall for over a decade,"" Morano continued. ""This is the longest such drought on record."""
2580,"Climate change is the biggest scam in the history of the world – a $1.5 trillion-a-year conspiracy against the taxpayer, every cent, penny and centime of which ends in the pockets of the wrong kind of people, none of which goes towards a cause remotely worth funding, all of it a complete and utter waste.

Nowhere is this truer in the field of the environment which, I sincerely believe – and I’ve been doing a lot of research into this – must count among the biggest wastes of tax money in the history of the world.

Last year Climate Change Business Journal – calculated that the total annual spend on the climate change industry is $1.5 trillion a year.

All those carbon traders, climate researchers, renewables and biofuels experts, environment correspondents, professors of climate science at the University of East Anglia and the Potsdam Institute, sustainability officers on local councils, and so on, add up the cost of their grants and salaries – and $1.5 trillion per year is the ballpark figure you reach.

So what does $1.5 trillion look like in a global economic context?

Well, it’s roughly the amount we spend every year on the online shopping industry.

$1.5 trillion on the global warming industry; $1.5 trillion on the online shopping industry.

But there’s a key difference between these two industries.

One exists to provide buyers and sellers what they want – to their mutual benefit; the other is a sham.

Buying stuff on the internet: it’s really useful, isn’t it? It has had a dramatically transforming effect on our quality of life, the way you can order a book at 11 o’clock on a Sunday night and have it appear on your doorstep the very next day.

But how did this marvellous industry spring up? Was it because of all the special incentives and tax breaks granted by wise governments? Nope of course not. They weren’t necessary. The online shopping industry sprung up and grew and grew because it was what people wanted, where they chose – of their own volition – to spend their money.

Now compare and contrast the global warming industry – which I call a Potemkin industry – because that’s what it is: a fraud; a sham; a conspiracy against the taxpayer.

Do you want to have a guess how much that industry would be worth if it weren’t for all the money funnelled into it via government grants and taxpayer levies and subsidies and regulatory capture?

Pretty close to zero, I’d say. Take wind farms – my hobby horse. The cost of intermittent, unreliable wind energy is roughly twice the market rate for onshore wind; three times the market rate for onshore. Nobody’s going to pay that kind of money in the open market. The only way it’s going to happen if people are mandated by the government to do so: which is what of course has happened across Europe and in the US.

Warren Buffett has said it: “wind farms don’t make sense without the tax credit.”

They’re inefficient; they kill birds and bats; they spoil views; they’re environmentally unfriendly – rare earth minerals from China; they’re hazardous; they’re expensive; they’re ugly (well I think they are….)

And in few countries is the damage these monstrosities have done more obvious than in Germany, home of the hateful Energiewende.

Energiewende means Energy Transition. It has been a disaster, as Rupert Darwall noted in a recent Telegraph article.

In 2004, the Green energy minister, Jürgen Trittin, claimed that the extra cost of renewable energy on monthly bills was equivalent to the cost of a scoop of ice cream. Nine years later, CDU minister Peter Altmaier said Energiewende could cost around €1 trillion by the end of the 2030s. The cost of feed-in tariffs and other subsidies is currently €21.8bn a year; €20bn is being spent on a new north-south high voltage line and investment in other grid infrastructure is likely to double that number.

They cause real people real misery.

In 2013, 345,000 German households could not pay their electricity bills because Energiewende had made them so expensive.

That’s the financial damage they’ve caused. What about the environmental damage? Here we are in Germany, the Greenest nation on earth. Aren’t Greens supposed to care about animals? Well they don’t about bats, clearly.

Bats are special. The reason they’re so heavily protected by so many laws is that they are a K-selected species. That is, they reproduce very slowly, live a long time and are easy to wipe out. Having evolved with few predators – flying at night helps – bats did very well with this strategy until the modern world.

But now we have all those eco-friendly wind turbines. Or as I call them bird-slicing, bat-chomping eco-crucifixes. A recent study in Germany by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research showed that bats killed by German turbines may have come from places 1000 or more miles away. This would suggest that German turbines – which one study claims kill more than 200,000 bats a year – may be depressing populations across the entire northeastern portion of Europe.

Why would anyone put up such things. One reason and one reason only: follow the money.

Where does the money come from? Us!

Who made the decision to spend that money? Not us.

Oh definitely not us. Had it been us we might have done a bit of basic due diligence.

Like, OK, so these wind turbines are necessary you say to save the planet from the threat of catastrophic and unprecedented man-made global warming?

Correct.

So has the planet ever been as warm in human history as it is today?

Well, only in the Minoan warming period and the Roman warming period and the Medieval warming period.

Just those. Right. And presumably back then all that CO2 heavy industry was burning was a real problem? No just kidding…Out of interest how much has the planet warmed in the last few years?

About 0.8 degrees C since 1850.

Right so since the end of the Little Ice Age (so called because it was characterised by unpleasant cold) and years like the infamous Year Without A Summer (1816), the planet has heated by less than the temperature increase you’d get on a spring day between say breakfast and mid-morning coffee time?

Ah yes but the computer models…

Indeed the computer models. Those amazing models which have been predicting catastrophic, runaway warming, when there has been no significant warming since 1998 – so for eighteen years there has been no global warming?

Ah yes but the temperatures of February 2016….

Look I could go on like this forever. I’ve been listening to these increasingly desperate excuses for decades. Perhaps some of you here believe them – if so, there’s a bridge I’d like to sell you…

But it really doesn’t matter whether you believe in global warming or not because here’s the reality:

All that money we’re being to spend on the global warming industry – that $1.5 trillion I mentioned earlier siphoned straight out of taxpayers’ pockets – it isn’t going to make the blindest bit of difference.

No, I exaggerate. It will make a teeny weeny bit of difference. Bjorn Lomborg has done the calculations. You’re going to love this, if you haven’t heard this before. These figures are just amazing.

So recently you’ll recall there was a big UN climate conference in Paris COP 21 and all the leaders of the world flew in to save the planet from global warming. But before they turned up, each delegate nation made a voluntary agreement as to how much it was going to cut its carbon emissions. Not compulsory, note. So these countries are free at any stage to abandon their carbon reduction targets – as funnily enough South Korea did last week. This is how much – best case scenario – that various countries are prepared to do to combat climate change.

So Lomborg added up all the countries INDCs – that stands for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions – and worked out, using the climate alarmists’ own models, what effect all this would have on global temperature.

Do you want to know how much? (Oh this is the optimistic scenario by the way, not the pessimistic one).

If all the countries do their bit then the total reduction in global warming – by the year 2100 will be 0.170 degrees Centigrade.

As a climate sceptic friend of mine pointed out at the time, you’d experience a bigger temperature increase than that just walking down from the top to the bottom of the Eiffel tower.

So there’s your deal folks: you – and taxpayers like you – are paying $1.5 trillion a year to reduce the world’s temperatures by the end of this century by 0.170.

It’s so perfectly ridiculous it’s almost funny.

And I suppose on a personal level I shouldn’t complain. I call climate change “the gift that goes on giving” because day in day out I get an endless stream of stories to write about the corruption, incompetence, skullduggery of the climate alarmism industry.

But, putting my career aside for the moment, is this really a world we’d like to live in? Can it be right that people who have worked hard for their money should have it taken from them and then wasted in so spectacular fashion?

And it’s not just the waste that’s so bad it’s worse than that.

If it were simply a form of taxpayer-funded welfare scheme for otherwise unemployable environmental sciences graduates that would be one thing.

But this is causing real, lasting harm in any number of ways.

The corrupting effects on science – and the scientific method – which at times are almost redolent of Lysenkoism of the Stalin era.

The brainwashing of schoolchildren such as you might have found with the Young Pioneers.

The economic damage caused by the misallocation of resources, as so frequently happens in Communist countries

The pollution caused by diesel (introduced, on EU recommendation, because it’s supposedly more CO2-friendly) which calls to mind Chernobyl or the poisoning of the Aral Sea.

The human suffering of those 345,000 German households I mentioned who can’t pay their electricity bills.

Does this authoritarianism and corruption and incompetence remind you of anything?

Well it has often been said – and there is much anecdotal evidence to support this – that after the Berlin Wall came down the left had a bit of a problem. Capitalism had won the economic argument. Where could the left go next?

But the solution was there waiting them – the green movement. In the guise of saving the world’s environment they could advance all their usual obsessions – control, regulation, state intervention, puritanism, compulsory immiseration – though this time with a smiling, fluffy face. Watermelons they call them: green on the outside, red on the inside.

So the Berlin Wall came down but it never really went away.

And sometimes I look at the world and what has been happening with the rise and rise of green lunacy and I ask myself: did the right side really win the Cold War or is it just an illusion?"
2584,"Millions may lose coverage next year if Congress does not repeal Obamacare. That’s not what this week’s Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis says, but it is reality. CBO’s estimating models seem impervious to reality. In the real world, the Obamacare exchanges are in crisis, millions of uninsured people willingly pay or avoid IRS penalties, and consumers struggle with rising premiums and cost-sharing requirements. But for CBO, Obamacare is a sea of tranquility. The agency assumes that only 26 million people under the age of 65 will be uninsured this year and next if Obamacare is left in place. To hit that mark, 2 million fewer people would have to be uninsured this year than last. That seems unlikely. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) estimates that 27.9 million people under age 65 lacked coverage as of September 30 last year, the most recent date for which government survey data are available. That represents little improvement over its estimate of 28.4 million as of December 2015, meaning that the number of non-elderly uninsured declined by only half a million through the first nine months of last year. Since then, the Obamacare individual exchanges have begun to implode. Fewer people signed up during the open-enrollment period this year than last, due in part to premium hikes that averaged 25 percent. Other insurance companies didn’t bother raising prices; they fled the exchanges. By January, 1,000 counties were down to their last insurer. Five entire states have just a single company selling through the exchanges. A rational observer might worry that the exchanges were on the brink of doom. Not CBO. Its analysts believe that Obamacare is on the cusp of a miracle. The number of nonelderly uninsured not only will drop this year but hold steady in 2018, according to CBO, even though millions could find themselves without an insurer in their exchanges. That improbably happy outcome would change, the agency says, if Congress were to enact its repeal bill. In that case, CBO warns, the number of uninsured will abruptly increase by 4 million. That includes 2 million Medicaid beneficiaries. CBO believes they will drop out of a program for which they pay virtually nothing and that fully pays virtually all their medical expenses. Ditto for 1 million people in the exchanges and an additional million with job-based coverage. CBO believes that these 4 million people so detest being insured that they will drop out of the system immediately after Congress repeals the tax on the uninsured. That number will rise to 14 million next year, according to CBO. That includes 5 million who will abandon Medicaid, 2 million who will drop their employer-sponsored coverage, and 6 million who will leave the exchanges. These 14 million people will not, despite what you’ve read, “lose coverage.” For the most part, CBO says, they “will choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying penalties” [emphasis added]. The GOP bill not only retains existing subsidies and Medicaid expansion through 2019, it provides additional money to states to stabilize their failing Obamacare exchanges. But that spending, according to CBO, won’t halt the stampede to the Obamacare exits induced by repeal of the individual mandate. CBO’s illusions about the effectiveness of the mandate don’t square with reality. The evidence suggests that the mandate has done little to reduce the number of uninsured. The IRS reports that in 2015, 6.5 million paid the penalty, 12.7 million obtained an exemption, while 4.3 million simply ignored it. That’s 23.5 million people who have chosen to be uninsured despite the government’s threat of tax penalties. CBO’s estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. Let’s do the math. NHIS estimates that 44.3 million non-elderly were uninsured in 2013, the year before Obamacare was fully implemented. If CBO is to be believed, the number of uninsured will increase by 14 million next year, joining another 23.5 million uninsured people who either paid the tax in the past or found a way to avoid it. That would mean that 85 percent of the uninsured (37.5 million out of 44.3 million) apparently would want nothing to do with Obamacare’s government-defined and subsidized benefits were Congress to repeal the individual mandate. If CBO is correct, the government will have spent $462 billion between 2014 and 2018 on subsidies and Medicaid expansions, only to end up reducing the number of nonelderly uninsured from 44.3 million to 41 million. It is also possible that CBO is wrong about the individual mandate. That seems intuitively obvious to people whose heads aren’t buried in CBO’s faulty models. Some future progressive government may well decide to attack the problem of homelessness by supplementing the mortgage-interest deduction with a tax on the homeless. But does anyone believe that if a Republican Congress repealed that tax, homeowners would shred their mortgages and head to the grates? CBO’s estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. They begin with rosy assumptions about the current law. In the face of considerable contrary evidence, they assume that insurers will continue to sell in the exchanges next year and that there will be no appreciable disruption in coverage. They appear to believe that higher coverage rates that have occurred since 2014 are more attributable to tax penalties than to subsidies, despite feckless IRS enforcement. And they assume that even if Congress keeps the tax credits and Medicaid expansion in place next year and spends additional money to stabilize insurance markets, 14 million more people will join the ranks of the uninsured. Congress should set policy based on reality, not on CBO’s speculations. Obamacare exchanges are falling apart, Medicaid spending is growing at an excessive pace, and taxing the uninsured is both ineffective and politically unsustainable. The House and Senate should act now to stabilize those markets, repeal the law (including the individual mandate), and replace it with a system that puts doctors and patients in control of health-care decision-making.

2585,"Come November, the grim trudge across the increasingly barren Obamacare landscape begins anew. Illinois consumers likely face staggering price hikes for individual insurance policies. Some types of plans could cost an average of 43 percent to 55 percent more. Ditto across the country: A first tranche of states approved 2017 rates with similarly cardiac-arrest-inducing premium increases.

Many Illinois consumers will find fewer choices because major carriers fled this market. UnitedHealthcare bolted. So did Aetna. Land of Lincoln Health collapsed mid-year, leaving policy holders to scramble for coverage that could cost them plenty. In many places across Illinois and the nation, people will find drastically fewer choices of plans than they did last year.

States struggling with Obamacare are undermining the law
The Affordable Care Act has been criticized since it was passed in 2010. Its success depended on states supporting their marketplaces and enrolling healthy consumers. Sept. 7, 2016.
Those insurers fled because they didn't want to lose more money on a government-run market that is so far out of whack — a market they think likely will never be profitable for them. That isn't surprising, as we enumerate below.

But by diagnosing Obamacare, all of us can see the mistakes that any repair or replacement can avoid. So let's look at the failings and how they can drive solutions:

Obamacare failed because it flunked Economics 101 and Human Nature 101. It straitjacketed insurers into providing overly expensive, soup-to-nuts policies. It wasn't flexible enough so that people could buy as much coverage as they wanted and could afford — not what the government dictated. Many healthy people primarily want catastrophic coverage. Obamacare couldn't lure them in, couldn't persuade them to buy on the chance they'd get sick.

Obamacare failed because the penalties for going uncovered are too low when stacked against its skyrocketing premium costs. Next year, the penalty for staying uninsured is $695 per adult, or perhaps 2.5 percent of a family's taxable household income. That's far less than many Americans would pay for coverage.

Obamacare failed because insurance is based on risk pools — that is, the lucky subsidize the unlucky. The unlucky who have big health problems (and big medical bills) reap much greater benefits than those who remain healthy and out of the doctors' office. But Obamacare's rules hamstring insurers. They can't exclude people for pre-existing conditions, and can't charge older customers more than three times as much as the young. Those are good goals, but they skew the market in ways Obamacare didn't figure out how to offset. Result: Young and healthy consumers pay far more in premiums than their claims (probably) would justify in order to subsidize the unexpectedly large influx of older, sicker customers who require expensive care. Too many unlucky people, too few lucky people: That will collapse any insurance scheme.

Obamacare failed because it allowed Americans to sign up after they got sick and needed help paying all those medical bills. Insurance should be structured so that, although you don't know if you'll need it, you pay for it anyway, just in case; your alternative is financial doom. But if you can game the system and, for example, buy auto coverage after you crash into your garage, then you have no incentive to buy insurance beforehand.

Obamacare failed because it hasn't tamed U.S. medical costs. Health care is about supply and demand: People who get coverage use it, especially if the law mandates free preventive care. Iron law of economics: Nothing is free; someone pays. To pretend otherwise was folly. Those forces combined to spike the costs of care, and thus insurance costs.

Obamacare failed because too many carriers simply can't cover expenses, let alone turn a profit, in this rigidly controlled system. Take Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, the state's dominant Obamacare insurer. Last year, for every dollar the carrier collected, it spent $1.32 buying care and providing services for customers, according to BCBS President Maurice Smith. No wonder BCBS is proposing rate increases from 23 percent to 45 percent for its individual plans.

A question looms: Is Obamacare plunging in a so-called insurance death spiral? Is the market so unstable that plans are doomed to get more and more expensive, driving more Americans and more insurers out of the market until ... Obamacare thuds to the pavement?

More Americans have health insurance, for now
We won't predict that, but neither do we see a mathematical alternative. What's clear is that the solutions to Obamacare are implicit in its failures. A repaired or replaced system has to be more flexible, letting insurers offer a wider range of plans so that consumers, not lawmakers or bureaucrats, dictate what's best for them. That system should protect those who carry continuous coverage, not coddle those who duck in and out of plans when their health needs change.

A new system also should scrap the job-killing Obamacare mandates that discourage companies from hiring and discourage workers from adding hours. Instead of gearing subsidies to incomes, let Americans not covered via an employer reap tax credits to help finance their insurance purchases on the open market. And tell us again: Why can't insurers sell policies across state lines? Imagine the pricing competition that would unleash.

We can deny the current system's failings, or we can parlay our evolving knowledge into something much better.

Put another way: The next president and Congress either reckon with Obamacare's failures or ... wait for the thud."
2586,"Remember how much Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare?

The Republican majority in the House of Representatives has voted more than 50 times to repeal the law. Conservatives have twice brought challenges to the Supreme Court — a court with powerful voices that often lean in their direction — only to be largely rebuffed both times. The last government shutdown was driven by Republicans who insisted on defunding Obamacare (not to be confused with what may be the next government shutdown, driven by Republicans insisting on defunding Planned Parenthood).

Some suggest that the calls for repealing Obamacare are fading. Sarah Kliff argued that the “near-complete absence of Obama’s health overhaul” in last week’s Republican presidential debate was “remarkable.”

Maybe, but don’t count on it. In GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush’s white paper on how he would get to 4 percent growth through supply-side tax cuts, his team of economists stresses that repealing the Affordable Care Act will be an “important means of enhancing economic growth.” Front-runner Donald Trump said just last week that he was going to replace Obamacare with “DonaldCare,” which would be both “absolutely great” and “really spectacular.” Repealing health-care reform remains a prominent talking point for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ted Cruz, both GOP presidential candidates.

Well, since we don’t know what’s in it, I can’t comment on DonaldCare.

But I can tell you this about Obamacare: When it comes to meeting one of its most important goals — providing coverage to the uninsured — it is working extremely well. It’s posting historical gains on this front and, in so doing, both insulating itself from repeal and creating a daunting political challenge for its opponents.

The facts of the case are thoroughly drawn out in this new analysis by my colleagues Matt Broaddus and Edwin Park (B&P) from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:

— As the figure above shows, newly released census data show that the share of those without health coverage fell from 13.3 percent to 10.4 last year.

— That’s the largest single-year drop on record based on data going back to 1987.

— In this type of work, the strength of your findings are much bolstered when you see them across multiple sources. As B&P point out, the census findings are “consistent with the historic coverage gains measured in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention’s National Health Interview Survey and several private surveys…at 9.2 percent, the CDC’s estimated uninsured rate for the first quarter of 2015 was the lowest since the CDC began collecting these data in 1997 and more than 40 percent below the peak in 2010.”

— The ACA takes a two-pronged attack on covering the uninsured, subsidizing private coverage through the exchanges and expanding Medicaid in the 25 states (as well as D.C.) that accepted that part of the deal. Both private and public coverage are making significant gains.

— Speaking of anti-Obamacare ideology and its effect on people, B&P provide this revealing calculation: “If the uninsured rate had fallen in non-expansion states at the same rate as in expansion states, an additional 2.6 million uninsured Americans would have gained coverage last year.”

— Coverage last year grew most quickly among households with income below $50,000; their uninsured rate fell from about 20 percent to about 15 percent — in one year! Households above $50,000 had lower uninsured rates to start with, so we would expect smaller changes, but they, too, went from 9 percent to 7.4 percent.

Such truths are more than inconvenient for sworn enemies of the law. They can bob and weave in their primaries, but once they reach the general election, their Democratic opponent will slam them on these points. And unless they’re willing to massively flip — pretty unimaginable, given the heat generated by the issue for conservatives — people represented in the numbers and charts above will rightfully fear that their health security is at stake.

I cannot overemphasize the importance of these facts, and, yes, I know better than most that our political discourse too often exists in a fact-free zone. But the success of the ACA strikes at the heart of the dysfunction strategy employed extremely effectively by anti-government conservatives. This is the self-fulfilling-prophecy strategy that campaigns on: “Washington is broken! Send me there and I’ll make sure it stays that way!”

Remember, when government messes up, when it shuts down, when it fails to address the things that matter to most people — economic opportunity, wage stagnation, affordable college — and, instead, squabbles about Planned Parenthood, the winners are those who can say: “See? We told you. Government’s broken!” Never mind that those making that case are the ones doing the breaking.

But with Obamacare, they’ve been failing, and the more we elevate that case, the closer we get to the road back to Factville."
